- **Persistent memory**: Non-volatile memory technologies that maintain data without power while providing memory-like access characteristics, enabling new programming models that blur the distinction between memory and storage.

- **CXL (Compute Express Link)**: An open industry standard interconnect offering coherent memory access between processors and devices like accelerators, memory expanders, and smart NICs, critical for memory pooling and disaggregation.

- **Memristive computing**: Using memristor devices (resistive memory with analog behavior) to perform computation, particularly suited for neural network operations through direct implementation of vector-matrix multiplication in crossbar arrays.
