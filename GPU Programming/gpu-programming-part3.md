# GPU Architecture Deep Dive

*Welcome to the third installment of our GPU programming series! Having covered the fundamentals of parallel computing, we're now ready to explore the intricate architecture of modern GPUs. Understanding this architecture is crucial for writing efficient GPU code and making informed optimization decisions.*

## Modern GPU Hardware Components and Organization

### The Evolution of GPU Architecture

Modern GPU architectures have evolved dramatically from their fixed-function graphics pipeline origins. Today's GPUs are highly programmable parallel processors with complex organizations optimized for both graphics and general-purpose computing.

Let's examine the key architectural generations that have shaped modern GPUs:

- **Pre-2006**: Fixed-function pipelines with limited programmability through shader programs
- **2006-2010**: Unified shader architectures emerge (NVIDIA Tesla, AMD TeraScale)
- **2010-2016**: Dedicated compute capabilities added (NVIDIA Fermi, Kepler, Maxwell; AMD GCN)
- **2016-Present**: Specialized hardware for AI, raytracing, and heterogeneous computing (NVIDIA Volta, Turing, Ampere, Hopper; AMD RDNA, CDNA)

### High-Level GPU Organization

At a high level, a modern GPU consists of:

1. **Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs)** or **Shader Engines**: Top-level organizational units containing multiple streaming multiprocessors
2. **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)** or **Compute Units (CUs)**: The primary computational building blocks
3. **Memory Controllers**: Interfaces to high-bandwidth memory
4. **Special Function Units**: Hardware for specific operations (texture filtering, raytracing, tensor operations)
5. **Command Processors**: Manage work submission and scheduling

### Inside a Streaming Multiprocessor/Compute Unit

The SM/CU is the workhorse of GPU computation. Each SM typically contains:

- **CUDA Cores/Stream Processors**: Simple scalar processors for arithmetic operations
- **Special Function Units (SFUs)**: Hardware for transcendental functions (sin, cos, exp, etc.)
- **Load/Store Units**: Handle memory operations
- **Tensor Cores** (in newer NVIDIA GPUs): Specialized for matrix multiplication
- **RT Cores** (in NVIDIA RTX GPUs): Accelerate ray-triangle intersection calculations
- **Warp Schedulers/Wavefront Schedulers**: Manage thread execution
- **Register File**: Ultra-fast storage for thread-local variables
- **Shared Memory/L1 Cache**: Fast memory shared between threads in a block
- **Texture Units**: Specialized hardware for texture sampling operations

A modern high-end GPU might contain 40-80+ SMs, each with dozens or hundreds of cores, resulting in thousands of cores in total.

### Execution Model: Warps and Wavefronts

GPUs execute threads in groups called **warps** (NVIDIA) or **wavefronts** (AMD):

- A warp typically consists of 32 threads (NVIDIA) or 64 threads (AMD)
- All threads in a warp execute the same instruction at the same time (SIMT model)
- If threads in a warp need to execute different code paths (branch divergence), the warp executes each path serially, disabling threads that don't take that path
- Warp scheduling is handled by hardware and is mostly transparent to the programmer

This execution model is key to understanding performance characteristics of GPU code, particularly the impact of branching and divergent execution.

## Memory Hierarchy in GPUs

GPUs feature a complex memory hierarchy with different types of memory optimized for specific access patterns and use cases.

### Global Memory

**Global memory** is the primary, largest memory space on the GPU:

- Accessible by all threads across all SMs
- High capacity (several GB to tens of GB in modern GPUs)
- High latency (hundreds of clock cycles)
- High bandwidth (up to 1-2 TB/s in high-end GPUs)
- Persists for the duration of the application

Efficient global memory access requires coalescing—adjacent threads accessing adjacent memory locations—to maximize bandwidth utilization.

### Shared Memory

**Shared memory** (or **local data share** in AMD terminology) is a programmer-managed cache:

- Accessible by all threads within the same thread block/workgroup
- Low latency (comparable to L1 cache)
- Limited capacity (typically tens of KB per SM)
- Organized into banks for parallel access
- Manually allocated and managed by the programmer
- Temporary lifetime (exists only for the duration of a thread block)

Shared memory is crucial for high-performance GPU computing, allowing threads to collaborate and reuse data without expensive global memory accesses.

### Constant Memory

**Constant memory** is a specialized read-only memory space:

- Optimized for broadcasting (all threads reading the same address)
- Cached for efficient access
- Limited size (typically 64KB total)
- Persists for the duration of the kernel

Ideal for lookup tables, coefficients, and other read-only data that remains constant during kernel execution.

### Texture Memory

**Texture memory** is optimized for spatial locality in 1D, 2D, or 3D data:

- Hardware-accelerated filtering and interpolation
- Cached for 2D spatial locality
- Read-only during kernel execution
- Support for normalized coordinates and boundary handling

While designed for graphics, texture memory can accelerate certain computing workloads with specific access patterns.

### Registers

**Registers** are the fastest memory on the GPU:

- Private to each thread
- Extremely low latency (single cycle access)
- Limited quantity (typically thousands per SM, shared among all active threads)
- Allocated by the compiler

Register pressure (using too many registers per thread) can limit occupancy by reducing the number of threads that can run concurrently on an SM.

### Local Memory

**Local memory** (not to be confused with shared memory) is thread-private memory that spills to global memory:

- Used when a thread exceeds its register allocation
- Physically located in global memory (high latency)
- Automatically managed by the compiler

Heavy local memory usage often indicates a performance problem that should be addressed by reducing per-thread register usage.

## Compute Units, SIMD, and Thread Execution Models

### SIMD vs. SIMT Execution

While traditional CPU SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operates on fixed-width vector registers, GPUs use SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads):

- **SIMD**: One instruction processes multiple data elements in a vector register
- **SIMT**: One instruction is executed by multiple independent threads in lockstep

The SIMT model provides more flexibility than pure SIMD, allowing features like independent thread addressing and predicated execution for handling divergent control flow.

### Thread Hierarchy

GPU programming models organize threads in a hierarchical structure:

**CUDA Terminology:**
- **Thread**: Individual execution context with its own registers and program counter
- **Warp**: Group of 32 threads executed together in SIMT fashion
- **Block**: Group of threads (up to 1024 in modern GPUs) that can cooperate via shared memory
- **Grid**: Collection of blocks executing the same kernel

**OpenCL Terminology:**
- **Work-item**: Equivalent to a CUDA thread
- **Wavefront**: Group of work-items executed together (typically 64 on AMD)
- **Workgroup**: Equivalent to a CUDA block
- **NDRange**: Equivalent to a CUDA grid

This hierarchy maps to the physical architecture, with blocks/workgroups assigned to SMs/CUs and threads/work-items executed in warps/wavefronts.

### Scheduling and Latency Hiding

GPUs achieve high throughput despite memory latency through massive parallelism and sophisticated scheduling:

- **Zero-overhead thread switching**: Warp schedulers can switch between warps with no context switch penalty
- **Latency hiding**: When one warp is waiting for memory, others can execute
- **Instruction-level parallelism**: Multiple independent instructions from the same warp can execute concurrently
- **Occupancy**: The ratio of active warps to the maximum possible warps on an SM

High occupancy helps hide latency but isn't always necessary for optimal performance if there's sufficient instruction-level parallelism within each warp.

## How GPUs Handle Massive Parallelism

### Work Distribution and Load Balancing

GPUs distribute work across SMs through hardware schedulers:

- Thread blocks are assigned to SMs based on resource availability
- Once assigned, a block remains on its SM until completion
- Blocks are scheduled independently, allowing for natural load balancing
- Optimal performance typically requires many more blocks than SMs

### Dynamic Parallelism

Modern GPUs support dynamic parallelism—the ability for GPU code to launch additional GPU work:

- Kernels can launch child kernels
- Enables recursive algorithms and adaptive workloads
- Introduces overhead, so should be used judiciously

### Synchronization Mechanisms

GPUs provide several synchronization mechanisms with different scopes and performance characteristics:

- **__syncthreads()** (CUDA) or **barrier()** (OpenCL): Synchronizes all threads in a block
- **Atomic operations**: Allow for thread-safe updates to shared data
- **Memory fences**: Ensure memory operation ordering
- **Grid synchronization** (newer GPUs): Synchronize across all blocks in a grid

Synchronization can be expensive, particularly across thread blocks, and should be minimized for optimal performance.

### Hardware-Accelerated Functions

Modern GPUs include specialized hardware for common operations:

- **Tensor Cores**: Accelerate mixed-precision matrix multiplication (crucial for deep learning)
- **RT Cores**: Speed up ray-triangle intersection tests for ray tracing
- **Texture Units**: Provide hardware-accelerated interpolation and filtering
- **Rasterizers**: Convert vector graphics to pixels efficiently

Leveraging these specialized units can provide order-of-magnitude performance improvements for suitable workloads.
