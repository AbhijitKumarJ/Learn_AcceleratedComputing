# Lesson 3: Optical Computing and Photonics

## Introduction
Optical computing represents a paradigm shift in information processing, leveraging the unique properties of light to perform computation. While electronic computing relies on the movement of electrons through semiconductors, optical computing utilizes photons—particles of light—to carry and process information. This approach offers fundamental advantages in speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency that could potentially overcome the limitations of electronic computing as we approach the physical limits of semiconductor scaling. From specialized accelerators for artificial intelligence to ultra-fast signal processing, optical computing and photonics are opening new frontiers in computational capabilities.

## Key Terminology and Concept Definitions
- **Photonics**: The science and technology of generating, controlling, and detecting photons. Photonics encompasses the generation of light, its manipulation through components like waveguides and modulators, and its detection through photodetectors.

- **Silicon Photonics**: Integration of photonic systems on silicon substrates, leveraging existing semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure. Silicon photonics enables the creation of optical components using the same CMOS fabrication processes used for electronic chips, facilitating integration and mass production.

- **Optical Neural Network**: Neural network implementation using optical components for computation, typically leveraging the inherent ability of optics to perform parallel matrix operations. These networks use light for both data transmission and computation, potentially offering orders of magnitude improvements in speed and energy efficiency.

- **Coherent Computing**: Computing using both the amplitude and phase information of light, enabling more complex operations through interference effects. Coherent optical systems can perform operations like complex-valued matrix multiplication and convolution directly in the optical domain.

- **Non-coherent Computing**: Computing using only the intensity (amplitude squared) of light, which simplifies implementation but limits certain operations. Non-coherent systems are typically more robust to environmental factors but cannot leverage phase information for computation.

- **Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)**: Optical device that splits and recombines light to create interference patterns, which can be used to implement programmable optical transformations. MZIs are fundamental building blocks in many optical computing architectures, particularly for matrix operations.

- **Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC)**: Chip that contains photonic components that operate with light, analogous to electronic integrated circuits but using photons instead of electrons. PICs can integrate lasers, modulators, waveguides, splitters, and detectors on a single substrate.

- **Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)**: Technique that enables multiple optical signals of different wavelengths to be transmitted simultaneously through the same medium, enabling massive parallelism. WDM is a key advantage of optical systems, allowing multiple computations to occur simultaneously on different wavelengths.

- **Electro-optic Modulator**: Device that changes the properties of light (amplitude, phase, or polarization) based on an applied electrical signal, enabling the conversion of electronic data to optical signals. Modulators are critical interface components between electronic and photonic domains.

- **Photodetector**: Component that converts optical signals back into electrical signals, typically through the photoelectric effect. Photodetectors are essential for reading the results of optical computations and interfacing with electronic systems.

## Fundamentals of Optical Computing

### Physical Principles of Optical Computing

Optical computing leverages several fundamental physical principles:

1. **Wave Propagation**: Light behaves as an electromagnetic wave, propagating through waveguides according to Maxwell's equations. This wave nature enables interference-based computation.

2. **Superposition**: Multiple light waves can occupy the same physical space without interacting with each other, enabling parallel data transmission and processing.

3. **Interference**: When coherent light waves combine, they create interference patterns based on their relative phases. This principle enables complex operations like matrix multiplication in optical neural networks.

4. **Diffraction**: The bending of light around obstacles or through apertures, which can be harnessed for operations like Fourier transforms.

5. **Nonlinear Optics**: At high intensities, materials can exhibit nonlinear responses to light, enabling operations like switching, modulation, and implementation of activation functions.

### Basic Components of Optical Computing Systems

### Example 1: Simulating Basic Optical Matrix Multiplication

Here's a Python example using NumPy to simulate an optical matrix multiplication system based on a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) mesh:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    """

    with phase shifts theta and phi.

    ps1 = np.array([[np.exp(1j*theta), 0], [0, 1]])
    ps2 = np.array([[np.exp(1j*phi), 0], [0, 1]])
    
    # Compute the full MZI transfer matrix
    return bs @ ps2 @ bs @ ps1

def build_optical_mesh(weights, phases=None):
    """

    This is a simplified implementation that doesn't account for
    the full decomposition algorithm.

            mzi = np.eye(size, dtype=complex)
            sub_mzi = mzi_matrix(phases[i, j, 0], phases[i, j, 1])
            mzi[j:(j+2), j:(j+2)] = sub_mzi

    # Add noise to simulate imperfections in the optical system
    noise = noise_level * (np.random.normal(0, 1, result.shape) +

print("Optical result:", optical_result)
print("Expected result:", expected_result)
print("Error magnitude:", np.abs(optical_result - expected_result))

# Visualize the results

plt.bar(range(len(expected_result)), np.abs(expected_result), width=0.4, label='Expected', alpha=0.7)
plt.bar([x+0.4 for x in range(len(optical_result))], np.abs(optical_result), width=0.4, label='Optical', alpha=0.7)
