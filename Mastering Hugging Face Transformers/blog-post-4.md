# Fine-tuning Transformer Models

Welcome to the fourth installment of our "Mastering Hugging Face Transformers" series! In our previous posts, we introduced transformer models, explored their architecture, and learned how to use pre-trained models for inference. Now, we're ready to take the next step: fine-tuning these models on your own data.

In this post, we'll cover transfer learning concepts, how to prepare datasets using the Datasets library, various fine-tuning techniques, hyperparameter optimization, and methods for evaluating model performance.

## Transfer Learning Concepts

### What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. In the context of transformer models, this means leveraging the knowledge embedded in pre-trained models (trained on vast amounts of general data) and adapting it to specific downstream tasks with much less task-specific data.

This approach offers several advantages:

- **Reduced training time**: Fine-tuning is much faster than training from scratch
- **Lower computational requirements**: You can achieve good results with modest hardware
- **Better performance on small datasets**: The pre-trained knowledge helps the model generalize better
- **Faster convergence**: Models typically require fewer epochs to reach optimal performance

### How Transfer Learning Works with Transformers

Transfer learning with transformer models typically involves:

1. **Starting with a pre-trained model**: These models have learned general language representations from massive corpora
2. **Adapting the model architecture**: Adding task-specific layers (like classification heads) when needed
3. **Fine-tuning on domain data**: Updating the model weights using your specific dataset

During fine-tuning, you can choose to update all the model's parameters or freeze some layers and only train specific parts of the model. This decision depends on your dataset size, computational resources, and the similarity between your task and the pre-training objective.

## Preparing Datasets with Datasets Library

### Introduction to the Datasets Library

The Hugging Face Datasets library provides a unified interface for accessing and processing various datasets. It's designed to work seamlessly with the Transformers library and offers efficient data loading, processing, and caching mechanisms.

To install the library:

```python
pip install datasets
```

### Loading Datasets

You can load datasets from various sources:

**From the Hugging Face Hub:**

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a dataset from the Hub
dataset = load_dataset("glue", "sst2")
print(dataset)
```

**From local files:**

```python
# CSV files
dataset = load_dataset("csv", data_files="path/to/data.csv")

# JSON files
dataset = load_dataset("json", data_files="path/to/data.json")

# Text files (one example per line)
dataset = load_dataset("text", data_files="path/to/data.txt")
```

**Creating from dictionaries:**

```python
from datasets import Dataset

data = {
    "text": ["I love this movie", "This film is terrible"],
    "label": [1, 0]
}
dataset = Dataset.from_dict(data)
```

### Dataset Structure and Operations

Datasets in the library have a structure similar to pandas DataFrames but are optimized for NLP tasks:

```python
# Examine dataset structure
print(dataset)

# Access the training split
train_dataset = dataset["train"]

# Get a specific example
example = train_dataset[0]
print(example)

# Get dataset statistics
print(f"Dataset size: {len(train_dataset)}")
print(f"Features: {train_dataset.features}")
```

You can perform various operations on datasets:

```python
# Filter examples
filtered_dataset = train_dataset.filter(lambda example: len(example["text"]) > 50)

# Map a function to all examples
def add_length(example):
    example["length"] = len(example["text"])
    return example

processed_dataset = train_dataset.map(add_length)

# Shuffle the dataset
shuffled_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(seed=42)

# Select a subset
subset = train_dataset.select(range(100))
```

### Preprocessing for Transformer Models

To prepare datasets for transformer models, you need to tokenize the text and format it according to the model's requirements:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Define preprocessing function
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

# Apply to the entire dataset (this is done in batches under the hood)
tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Select the columns needed for training (remove raw text)
train_dataset = tokenized_dataset["train"].select_columns(
    ["input_ids", "attention_mask", "label"]
)
```

The `map` function processes the dataset in batches, making it efficient even for large datasets.

## Fine-tuning Techniques for Different Tasks

### Text Classification

Text classification is one of the most common NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, and intent detection.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Load pre-trained model with a classification head
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    "bert-base-uncased", 
    num_labels=2  # Binary classification
)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()

# Save the model
model.save_pretrained("./my_fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./my_fine_tuned_model")
```

### Token Classification (Named Entity Recognition)

Token classification involves assigning labels to individual tokens, such as identifying entities (people, organizations, locations) in text.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification

# Load pre-trained model with a token classification head
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(
    "bert-base-uncased",
    num_labels=9  # Number of entity types
)

# The rest of the training process is similar to text classification
# but requires token-level labels in the dataset
```

### Question Answering

Question answering models predict the span of text in a context that answers a given question.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForQuestionAnswering

# Load pre-trained model with a question answering head
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# For QA, the dataset needs to be processed differently
def preprocess_qa_dataset(examples):
    questions = [q.strip() for q in examples["question"]]
    inputs = tokenizer(
        questions,
        examples["context"],
        max_length=384,
        truncation="only_second",
        stride=128,
        return_overflowing_tokens=True,
        return_offsets_mapping=True,
        padding="max_length"
    )
    
    # Map from token indices to character positions
    # (required for finding answer spans)
    offset_mapping = inputs.pop("offset_mapping")
    
    # ... additional processing for answer spans ...
    
    return inputs
```

### Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks

Sequence-to-sequence tasks like summarization and translation require encoder-decoder models such as T5 or BART.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

# Load pre-trained seq2seq model
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("t5-base")

# For summarization
def preprocess_summarization_function(examples):
    inputs = ["summarize: " + doc for doc in examples["document"]]
    model_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=1024, truncation=True)
    
    # Tokenize the summaries
    labels = tokenizer(examples["summary"], max_length=128, truncation=True)
    model_inputs["labels"] = labels["input_ids"]
    
    return model_inputs
```

### Custom Training Loops

While the Trainer API simplifies the training process, you might want more control with a custom training loop:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from transformers import AdamW, get_scheduler

# Create DataLoader
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=True)

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

# Learning rate scheduler
num_epochs = 3
num_training_steps = num_epochs * len(train_dataloader)
lr_scheduler = get_scheduler(
    name="linear",
    optimizer=optimizer,
    num_warmup_steps=0,
    num_training_steps=num_training_steps
)

# Training loop
device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")
model.to(device)

model.train()
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
        outputs = model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        
        optimizer.step()
        lr_scheduler.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

## Hyperparameter Optimization

### Key Hyperparameters

Several hyperparameters significantly impact the fine-tuning process:

- **Learning rate**: Typically between 1e-5 and 5e-5 for transformer models
- **Batch size**: Often limited by GPU memory; larger batches can stabilize training
- **Number of epochs**: Usually between 2-10 epochs is sufficient
- **Weight decay**: Helps prevent overfitting, typically around 0.01
- **Warmup steps**: Gradually increasing the learning rate at the beginning of training

### Optimization Strategies

Hugging Face integrates with optimization libraries like Optuna and Ray Tune:

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer
from ray import tune
from ray.tune import CLIReporter
from ray.tune.schedulers import PopulationBasedTraining

def model_init():
    return AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        "bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2
    )

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model_init=model_init,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
)

# Define hyperparameter search space
param_space = {
    "learning_rate": tune.loguniform(1e-5, 5e-5),
    "per_device_train_batch_size": tune.choice([8, 16, 32]),
    "num_train_epochs": tune.choice([2, 3, 4]),
    "weight_decay": tune.uniform(0, 0.3),
}

# Run hyperparameter search
best_run = trainer.hyperparameter_search(
    hp_space=lambda _: param_space,
    direction="maximize",
    backend="ray",
    n_trials=10
)

print(f"Best hyperparameters: {best_run.hyperparameters}")
```

### Cross-Validation

For smaller datasets, cross-validation helps ensure robust performance:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

# Create 5-fold cross-validation
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

for fold, (train_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(kf.split(dataset)):
    print(f"Training fold {fold+1}")
    
    # Create train and validation splits
    train_subset = dataset.select(train_idx)
    val_subset = dataset.select(val_idx)
    
    # Initialize model and trainer
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        "bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2
    )
    
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=training_args,
        train_dataset=train_subset,
        eval_dataset=val_subset,
    )
    
    # Train and evaluate
    trainer.train()
    results = trainer.evaluate()
    print(f"Fold {fold+1} results: {results}")
```

## Evaluating Model Performance

### Metrics for Different Tasks

Different NLP tasks require different evaluation metrics:

- **Classification**: Accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall
- **Token classification**: Token-level F1, precision, recall
- **Generation tasks**: BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR
- **Question answering**: Exact match, F1 score over answer spans

The Datasets library includes a `evaluate` module with implementations of these metrics:

```python
from datasets import load_metric

# Load metric
metric = load_metric("accuracy")

# Make predictions
predictions = trainer.predict(test_dataset)
pred_labels = predictions.predictions.argmax(-1)

# Calculate metric
results = metric.compute(predictions=pred_labels, references=test_dataset["label"])
print(f"Accuracy: {results['accuracy']}")
```

### Custom Evaluation Functions

You can define custom evaluation functions for the Trainer:

```python
def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
    
    accuracy = load_metric("accuracy")
    f1 = load_metric("f1")
    
    return {
        "accuracy": accuracy.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels)["accuracy"],
        "f1": f1.compute(predictions=predictions, references=labels, average="weighted")["f1"],
    }

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)
```

### Analyzing Model Errors

Understanding where your model makes mistakes is crucial for improvement:

```python
# Get predictions
predictions = trainer.predict(test_dataset)
pred_labels = predictions.predictions.argmax(-1)

# Find misclassified examples
misclassified = []
for i, (pred, true) in enumerate(zip(pred_labels, test_dataset["label"])):
    if pred != true:
        misclassified.append({
            "text": test_dataset["text"][i],
            "true_label": true,
            "predicted_label": pred
        })

# Analyze patterns in misclassified examples
print(f"Number of misclassified examples: {len(misclassified)}")
for i, example in enumerate(misclassified[:10]):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"Text: {example['text']}")
    print(f"True label: {example['true_label']}")
    print(f"Predicted label: {example['predicted_label']}")
    print("---")
```

### Model Comparison

Comparing different models helps you choose the best one for your task:

```python
models_to_compare = [
    "bert-base-uncased",
    "distilbert-base-uncased",
    "roberta-base"
]

results = {}
for model_name in models_to_compare:
    print(f"Evaluating {model_name}...")
    
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        model_name, num_labels=2
    )
    
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=training_args,
        train_dataset=train_dataset,
        eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
        compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    )
    
    trainer.train()
    eval_results = trainer.evaluate()
    results[model_name] = eval_results

# Compare results
for model_name, result in results.items():
    print(f"{model_name}: {result}")
```

## Practical Tips for Successful Fine-tuning

### Dealing with Limited Data

When working with small datasets:

- **Data augmentation**: Create additional training examples through techniques like back-translation or synonym replacement
- **Few-shot learning**: Use prompt-based approaches with models like GPT-3 or T5
- **Freeze layers**: Only train the top layers of the model to prevent overfitting

```python
# Freeze the base model layers and only train the classification head
for param in model.base_model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
```

### Handling Class Imbalance

For imbalanced datasets:

- **Weighted loss function**: Assign higher weights to underrepresented classes
- **Oversampling**: Duplicate examples from minority classes
- **Undersampling**: Reduce examples from majority classes

```python
# Define class weights for imbalanced dataset
class_weights = torch.tensor([1.0, 5.0])  # Higher weight for minority class

# Custom training loop with weighted loss
model.train()
for batch in train_dataloader:
    batch = {k: v.to(device) for k, v in batch.items()}
    outputs = model(**batch)
    
    # Apply class weights to loss
    logits = outputs.logits
    loss_fct = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights.to(device))
    loss = loss_fct(logits.view(-1, model.config.num_labels), batch["labels"].view(-1))
    
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### Efficient Training Strategies

To optimize training efficiency:

- **Gradient accumulation**: Simulate larger batch sizes on limited hardware
- **Mixed precision training**: Use 16-bit floating-point operations to speed up training
- **Checkpointing**: Save intermediate model states to resume training if interrupted

```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,  # Effective batch size of 16
    fp16=True,  # Mixed precision training
    save_strategy="steps",
    save_steps=500,
)
```
