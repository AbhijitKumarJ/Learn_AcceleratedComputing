# Lesson 25: Sustainable and Green Computing Architectures

## Overview
This lesson explores the principles, technologies, and methodologies for designing environmentally sustainable computing systems. As computational demands grow exponentially, particularly in accelerated computing domains, the environmental impact of these systems becomes increasingly significant. We'll examine approaches to minimize energy consumption, reduce carbon footprint, and create more sustainable computing infrastructures.

The global IT sector currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of worldwide carbon emissions, comparable to the aviation industry. With the rapid growth of cloud computing, AI workloads, and high-performance computing, this footprint is projected to increase substantially unless counterbalanced by sustainable practices. This lesson addresses the urgent need for green computing approaches that can support computational advancement while minimizing environmental impact.
