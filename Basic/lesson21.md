## Key Terminology
- **Edge Computing**: Processing data near the source rather than in centralized cloud facilities
- **SoC (System on Chip)**: Integrated circuit that combines multiple components of a computer system
- **NPU (Neural Processing Unit)**: Specialized processor designed for accelerating neural network workloads
- **Quantization**: Technique to reduce model precision (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit) to improve efficiency
- **Inference**: The process of running a trained AI model to make predictions
- **TinyML**: Machine learning technologies optimized to run on microcontrollers and other resource-constrained devices
- **Federated Learning**: Training approach where the model comes to the data rather than data going to the model

## Practical Exercise
Select an edge AI application (e.g., person detection, keyword spotting) and:
1. Choose an appropriate edge hardware platform
2. Optimize a pre-trained model for the target device
3. Benchmark performance, power consumption, and accuracy
4. Implement power-saving strategies while maintaining acceptable performance

## Common Misconceptions
- "Edge devices can't run sophisticated AI models" - With proper optimization, even complex models can run efficiently
- "Cloud processing is always more powerful than edge" - For many applications, the latency and privacy benefits of edge processing outweigh raw computational power
- "Quantization always significantly degrades accuracy" - Modern techniques can preserve accuracy while dramatically reducing computational requirements

## Real-world Applications
- Smart doorbell cameras performing on-device person recognition
- Fitness trackers analyzing activity patterns locally
- Industrial sensors detecting anomalies without cloud connectivity
- Autonomous drones navigating via on-board vision processing
- Smart speakers with local wake-word detection and command processing
