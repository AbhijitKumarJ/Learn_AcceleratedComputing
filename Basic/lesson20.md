- Quantum interconnects for future computing systems

## Key Terminology
- **Bandwidth**: The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path
- **Latency**: The time delay between the initiation and execution of a data transfer
- **NVLink**: NVIDIA's high-speed GPU interconnect technology
- **PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)**: Standard interface for connecting high-speed components
- **RDMA**: Technology allowing direct memory access from one computer to another without CPU involvement
- **SmartNIC**: Network interface card with programmable processing capabilities
- **DPU (Data Processing Unit)**: Programmable networking device that offloads and accelerates infrastructure tasks

## Practical Exercise
Design a multi-GPU system architecture for a specific workload (e.g., large-scale deep learning training), considering:
1. Number and type of GPUs
2. Interconnect technology selection
3. Network topology
4. Expected bottlenecks and mitigation strategies

## Common Misconceptions
- "More GPUs always means better performance" - Without proper interconnects, scaling can be sublinear or worse
- "PCIe is always the bottleneck" - Modern PCIe generations provide significant bandwidth that may be sufficient for many workloads
- "Proprietary interconnects are always better than standard ones" - The best choice depends on workload characteristics and cost constraints

## Real-world Applications
- Large language model training clusters using NVLink and InfiniBand
- Financial services using RDMA for low-latency trading systems
- Cloud providers implementing SmartNICs for tenant isolation and security
- Supercomputers with custom network topologies for scientific simulations
