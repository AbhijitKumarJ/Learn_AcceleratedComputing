# Create a new Loihi graph
g = Graph()

# Define input and output compartment groups
input_group = g.createCompartmentGroup()
output_group = g.createCompartmentGroup()

# Create input neurons (100 neurons)
input_proto = g.createCompartmentPrototype()
input_proto.setCompartmentCurrentDecay(4095)  # Slow current decay
input_neurons = input_group.createCompartment(size=100, prototype=input_proto)

# Create output neurons (10 neurons) with LIF dynamics
output_proto = g.createCompartmentPrototype()
output_proto.setThreshold(100)
output_proto.setVoltageDecay(4000)  # Voltage decay parameter
output_proto.setBias(0)
output_neurons = output_group.createCompartment(size=10, prototype=output_proto)

# Create synapses between input and output neurons
# With spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule
synapse_proto = g.createSynapsePrototype()
synapse_proto.setLearningRule(stdpParams={
    'x1': 0,
    'x2': 10,
    'y1': 0,
    'y2': 1,
    'tau': 20
})

# Connect input to output with initial random weights
for i in range(100):
    for j in range(10):
        weight = np.random.randint(1, 10)  # Random initial weight
        input_neurons[i].connect(output_neurons[j], synapse_proto, weight)

# Define input spike generation process
def generate_input_spikes(g):
    # This SNIP will generate input spikes based on a pattern
    for t in range(100):  # For 100 timesteps
        if t % 10 == 0:  # Every 10 timesteps
            for i in range(0, 100, 2):  # Every other input neuron
                g.addSpike(input_neurons[i], t)

# Create embedded process for spike generation
spike_gen = EmbeddedSnip(g, generate_input_spikes)

# Define output spike monitoring process
def monitor_output_spikes(g):
    # This SNIP will monitor and record output spikes
    spikes = g.readSpikes(output_neurons)
    if len(spikes) > 0:
        print(f"Time {g.getTime()}: Output spikes at neurons {spikes}")

# Create embedded process for spike monitoring

# Compile the graph for Loihi
compiler = N2Compiler()
board = compiler.compile(g)

# Run the simulation for 1000 timesteps
board.run(1000)

# Retrieve and analyze results
# (Implementation depends on specific NxSDK version)
