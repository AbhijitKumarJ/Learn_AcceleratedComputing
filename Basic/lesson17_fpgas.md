# Lesson 17: FPGAs - Programmable Hardware Acceleration

## Introduction

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) represent a unique approach to hardware acceleration that offers flexibility not found in other accelerators. Unlike GPUs or CPUs with fixed architectures, FPGAs allow developers to configure the actual hardware circuits to match their specific computational needs. This lesson explores how FPGAs work, their advantages and limitations, and how they fit into the accelerated computing landscape.

## What are FPGAs and how they differ from GPUs and ASICs

FPGAs are integrated circuits designed to be configured by the user after manufacturingâ€”hence the term "field-programmable." This stands in stark contrast to:

- **CPUs**: General-purpose processors with fixed architecture optimized for sequential processing
- **GPUs**: Specialized processors with thousands of cores optimized for parallel workloads but with a fixed architecture
- **ASICs**: Custom chips designed for specific applications with maximum performance but zero flexibility after manufacturing

FPGAs occupy a middle ground between the flexibility of software and the performance of custom hardware. They can be reprogrammed thousands of times to implement different digital circuits, allowing hardware to be updated and improved without physical changes.

**Key differences:**
- **Flexibility**: FPGAs can be reconfigured for different algorithms; GPUs and ASICs cannot
- **Performance**: ASICs offer the highest performance for specific tasks, followed by FPGAs, then GPUs
- **Power efficiency**: FPGAs can be more power-efficient than GPUs for certain workloads
- **Development time**: FPGA development typically takes longer than GPU programming but is faster than ASIC design
- **Cost**: FPGAs are more expensive per unit than mass-produced ASICs but have lower upfront development costs

## The architecture of FPGAs: LUTs, DSP blocks, and memory elements

Modern FPGAs consist of several key components arranged in a reconfigurable fabric:

### Look-Up Tables (LUTs)
The fundamental building blocks of FPGAs are Look-Up Tables or LUTs. A LUT is essentially a small memory that implements any logical function by storing the output value for each possible input combination. Typical FPGAs use 4-input to 6-input LUTs that can implement any logical function with that many inputs.

### Flip-Flops
Adjacent to each LUT are one or more flip-flops (registers) that store the output of the LUT, enabling sequential logic and synchronous designs. These elements maintain state between clock cycles.

### Programmable Interconnects
A network of wires and programmable switches connects the LUTs, flip-flops, and other elements. This routing fabric allows for creating custom data paths between components.

### DSP Blocks
Modern FPGAs include dedicated Digital Signal Processing (DSP) blocks optimized for mathematical operations like multiplication, addition, and accumulation. These hardened blocks provide higher performance and power efficiency than implementing the same functions using LUTs.

### Block RAM (BRAM)
FPGAs contain blocks of embedded memory (BRAM) distributed throughout the chip. These memory blocks can be configured as RAM, ROM, FIFOs, or other memory structures, providing local storage for algorithms.

### I/O Blocks
Specialized I/O blocks support various electrical standards and protocols, allowing FPGAs to interface with external devices and systems.

### Hard Processor Systems
Many modern FPGAs include hard processor systems (HPS) such as ARM cores, creating a system-on-chip (SoC) that combines the flexibility of programmable logic with the software programmability of a processor.

## Hardware description languages: Introduction to VHDL and Verilog

FPGAs are traditionally programmed using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) that describe digital circuits rather than sequential instructions:

### Verilog
Developed in the 1980s, Verilog uses C-like syntax to describe hardware behavior and structure. It allows designers to work at different levels of abstraction:

```verilog
// Simple 2-input AND gate in Verilog
module and_gate(
    input a,
    input b,
    output y
);
    assign y = a & b;
endmodule
```

### VHDL
VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) was developed by the US Department of Defense and has a more verbose, Ada-like syntax. It's known for its strong typing and comprehensive error checking:

```vhdl
-- Simple 2-input AND gate in VHDL
entity and_gate is
    port(
        a, b : in std_logic;
        y : out std_logic
    );
end entity and_gate;

architecture rtl of and_gate is
begin
    y <= a and b;
end architecture rtl;
```

Both languages allow designers to describe:
- **Structural descriptions**: Explicitly specifying components and connections
- **Behavioral descriptions**: Describing the functionality without specifying the structure
- **Register Transfer Level (RTL)**: Describing data flow between registers

The HDL code is synthesized into a netlist that maps to the FPGA's resources, then placed and routed to determine the physical implementation on the chip.

## High-level synthesis: Programming FPGAs with C/C++

Traditional HDL programming requires hardware design expertise and can be time-consuming. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools allow software developers to program FPGAs using familiar languages like C, C++, or OpenCL:

```c
// Matrix multiplication in C for HLS
void matrix_multiply(int A[SIZE][SIZE], int B[SIZE][SIZE], int C[SIZE][SIZE]) {
    #pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=B complete dim=2
    
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
            #pragma HLS PIPELINE
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < SIZE; k++) {
                sum += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
            }
            C[i][j] = sum;
        }
    }
}
```

HLS tools analyze the code, identify parallelism, and generate optimized HDL. Pragmas or directives guide the tool to implement specific optimizations like pipelining, unrolling loops, or partitioning arrays.

Popular HLS tools include:
- Intel HLS Compiler
- Xilinx Vitis HLS
- Siemens Catapult HLS

Benefits of HLS:
- Reduced development time
- Accessibility for software developers
- Higher level of abstraction
- Easier algorithm exploration and optimization

Limitations:
- Less control over the final implementation
- May not achieve the same performance as hand-crafted HDL
- Learning curve for pragmas and hardware-oriented thinking

## Try It Yourself: Simple LED Counter

Here's a simple Verilog example that creates a counter to blink an LED at a visible rate:

```verilog
module led_counter(
    input wire clk,         // Clock input (typically 50MHz or 100MHz)
    input wire reset,       // Reset button
    output wire led         // LED output
);

    // 25-bit counter (for a visible blink rate from a fast clock)
    reg [24:0] counter;
    
    // Counter logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            counter <= 25'b0;
        end else begin
            counter <= counter + 1'b1;
        end
    end
    
    // Connect the LED to the most significant bit of the counter
    assign led = counter[24];
    
endmodule
```

**Exercise**: Modify this code to create a pattern of multiple LEDs blinking in sequence.
