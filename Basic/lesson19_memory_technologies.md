# Lesson 19: Memory Technologies for Accelerated Computing

## Introduction

While much attention in accelerated computing focuses on processing elements like GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, memory systems are equally critical to overall performance. In fact, many modern accelerated workloads are memory-bound rather than compute-bound, making memory technologies a key determinant of system performance. This lesson explores the memory hierarchy in accelerated systems, advanced memory technologies, and techniques to optimize memory access for maximum performance.

## The memory wall: Understanding bandwidth and latency challenges

The "memory wall" refers to the growing disparity between processor and memory performance. While compute capabilities have increased exponentially, memory access speeds have improved at a much slower rate, creating a fundamental bottleneck in computing systems.

### The Fundamental Challenge

Modern accelerators can perform trillions of operations per second, but accessing data from traditional memory systems can take hundreds or thousands of clock cycles. This creates a situation where processors spend significant time waiting for data rather than processing it.

### Key Memory Performance Metrics

1. **Bandwidth**: The rate at which data can be transferred between memory and processor, typically measured in GB/s (gigabytes per second).

2. **Latency**: The time delay between requesting data and receiving it, measured in nanoseconds or clock cycles.

3. **Capacity**: The total amount of data that can be stored, measured in gigabytes or terabytes.

4. **Energy efficiency**: The energy required to access or transfer data, typically measured in pJ/bit (picojoules per bit).

### The Memory Hierarchy

To balance performance, capacity, and cost, computing systems employ a memory hierarchy with multiple levels:

| Level | Technology | Capacity | Bandwidth | Latency | Energy |
|-------|------------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Registers | SRAM | KB | TB/s | 1 cycle | Lowest |
| L1 Cache | SRAM | KB | ~1 TB/s | 1-3 cycles | Very Low |
| L2 Cache | SRAM | MB | ~500 GB/s | 10-20 cycles | Low |
| L3 Cache | SRAM | MB-GB | ~200 GB/s | 40-60 cycles | Medium |
| HBM | DRAM | GB | ~1 TB/s | ~100 cycles | Medium-High |
| GDDR | DRAM | GB | ~500 GB/s | ~200 cycles | High |
| DDR | DRAM | GB-TB | ~50 GB/s | ~300 cycles | High |
| SSD | NAND | TB | ~5 GB/s | ~10,000 cycles | Very High |
| HDD | Magnetic | TB | ~0.2 GB/s | ~1,000,000 cycles | Highest |

### Memory Wall Implications for Accelerators

Accelerators like GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs are particularly vulnerable to the memory wall because:

1. **Massive parallelism**: Thousands of processing elements can generate enormous memory bandwidth demands
2. **Data-intensive workloads**: AI, scientific computing, and data analytics require processing large datasets
3. **Specialized architectures**: Often optimized for computation without equivalent optimization for memory access
4. **Power constraints**: Memory access can consume more energy than computation

## HBM (High Bandwidth Memory): How it powers modern accelerators

High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) represents a revolutionary approach to memory design that addresses the bandwidth limitations of traditional DRAM.

### HBM Architecture

HBM achieves its high bandwidth through a fundamentally different architecture:

1. **3D stacking**: Multiple DRAM dies stacked vertically
2. **Silicon interposer**: Connects the memory stack to the processor
3. **Wide interface**: Thousands of connections in parallel (1024-4096 bits wide)
4. **Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)**: Vertical connections between stacked dies
5. **Proximity to processor**: Placed adjacent to the processor die in the same package

## GDDR vs HBM: Tradeoffs and applications

Graphics Double Data Rate (GDDR) memory and HBM represent different approaches to high-bandwidth memory, each with distinct advantages for different applications.

### GDDR Overview

GDDR is an evolution of DDR SDRAM optimized for graphics and other high-bandwidth applications:
- Planar (2D) layout on PCB
- Wider bus than standard DDR
- Higher clock frequencies
- Optimized for sustained bandwidth

### Comparison: GDDR6X vs HBM2E

| Characteristic | GDDR6X | HBM2E |

| Form Factor | 2D (planar) | 3D (stacked) |
| Interface Width | 32 bits per chip | 1024+ bits per stack |
| Clock Speed | ~20 Gbps | ~2.4 Gbps |
| Bandwidth per Device | ~80 GB/s | ~450 GB/s |
| Power Efficiency | Medium | High |
| Cost per GB | Lower | Higher |
| Implementation Complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Physical Footprint | Larger | Smaller |
| Typical Capacity | 8-24 GB | 16-80 GB |

### Application-Specific Considerations

**GDDR is preferred for**:
- Consumer graphics cards (NVIDIA GeForce, AMD Radeon)
- Mid-range AI accelerators
- Applications with moderate bandwidth needs
- Cost-sensitive products
- Simpler manufacturing requirements

**HBM is preferred for**:
- High-end data center GPUs (NVIDIA A100, AMD MI250)
- AI training accelerators
- HPC and supercomputing
- Bandwidth-critical applications
- Space-constrained designs
- Power-efficiency-focused systems

### Hybrid Approaches

Some systems use a combination of memory technologies:
- Fast but limited HBM for working data
- Larger GDDR or DDR memory for data storage
- Software-managed data movement between tiers

## Unified memory architectures explained

Unified memory architectures aim to simplify programming for heterogeneous systems by providing a single memory space accessible by all processing elements.

### The Challenge of Discrete Memory

In traditional heterogeneous systems:
- CPU has its own memory (system RAM)
- GPU has separate memory (GDDR/HBM)
- Other accelerators may have their own memory
- Programmers must explicitly manage data transfers
- Data often copied multiple times, wasting bandwidth and power

### Unified Memory Concept

Unified memory creates a single virtual address space shared by all processors:
- All processors see the same memory addresses
- Data automatically migrates to where it's needed
- Hardware and/or software manages coherence
- Programmers write code as if all data is local

### Implementation Approaches

**Hardware-Based Unified Memory**:
- Physical shared memory accessible by all processors
- Cache coherence protocols maintain consistency
- Example: Apple M1/M2 chips with shared CPU/GPU memory

**Virtual Unified Memory**:
- Physically separate memories appear as a single address space
- Page migration moves data between physical memories
- Example: NVIDIA CUDA Unified Memory

**Hybrid Approaches**:
- Some memory physically shared, some discrete
- Coherence domains with different properties
- Example: AMD APUs with shared CPU/GPU memory plus discrete GPU memory

### CUDA Unified Memory Example

```c
// Traditional CUDA memory management
float *h_data = (float*)malloc(size);
float *d_data;
cudaMalloc(&d_data, size);
// Initialize host data
cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
// Launch kernel
kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_data);
cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
// Process results
free(h_data);
cudaFree(d_data);

// With Unified Memory
float *data;
cudaMallocManaged(&data, size);
// Initialize data directly
kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(data);
cudaDeviceSynchronize();
// Process results directly
cudaFree(data);
```

### Benefits and Limitations

**Benefits**:
- Simplified programming model
- Reduced code complexity
- Automatic data locality optimization
- Elimination of redundant copies
- Better support for complex data structures

**Limitations**:
- Potential performance overhead from coherence
- Less explicit control over data placement
- May hide performance-critical operations
- Implementation-specific behaviors
- Debugging complexity when performance issues arise

## Memory coherence protocols for heterogeneous systems

Memory coherence ensures that all processors in a system see a consistent view of memory, which becomes increasingly complex in heterogeneous systems with different processor types and memory hierarchies.

### The Coherence Problem

In systems with multiple caches and processors:
- Multiple copies of the same data may exist in different locations
- Modifications to one copy must be reflected in all copies
- Different processors may operate at different speeds
- Memory access patterns vary by processor type

### Basic Coherence Protocols

**MESI Protocol** (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid):
- The foundation of most modern coherence protocols
- Tracks the state of each cache line
- Ensures writes are properly propagated
- Optimizes for common access patterns

**Directory-Based Coherence**:
- Centralized directory tracks ownership of cache lines
- Scales better than snooping protocols for many cores
- Reduces broadcast traffic
- Common in large-scale systems

**Snooping Protocols**:
- All caches monitor a shared bus for memory operations
- Simple but doesn't scale well to many processors
- Lower latency for small systems
- Limited by bus bandwidth

### Heterogeneous Coherence Challenges

Heterogeneous systems introduce unique challenges:
- Different processor types have different cache architectures
- Memory access patterns vary dramatically (e.g., GPU vs CPU)
- Power and performance tradeoffs differ by processor
- Some accelerators may not support full coherence

### Modern Heterogeneous Coherence Solutions

**AMD Infinity Fabric**:
- Connects CPU and GPU with coherent interface
- Supports different coherence domains
- Allows fine-grained sharing when needed
- Optimizes for both CPU and GPU access patterns

**NVIDIA NVLink with Coherence**:
- Grace-Hopper architecture provides CPU-GPU coherence
- Maintains coherence across CPU and GPU caches
- High-bandwidth, low-latency coherent interface
- Software can choose coherence granularity

**Intel Xe Architecture**:
- Unified memory architecture across CPU and GPU
- Coherent caches with different optimization levels
- Software-configurable coherence policies
- Balances programmability and performance

**ARM CCIX (Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators)**:
- Industry standard for coherent accelerator attachment
- Extends ARM coherence protocols to accelerators
- Flexible implementation options
- Supports heterogeneous processing elements

### Coherence Domains and Scopes

Modern systems often implement multiple coherence domains:
- **Full coherence**: All caches maintain strict coherence (high overhead)
- **Partial coherence**: Some memory regions are coherent, others not
- **Scoped coherence**: Coherence maintained within defined scopes (e.g., GPU workgroup)
- **Explicit coherence**: Software explicitly manages coherence when needed

## Smart memory: Computational storage and near-memory processing

Traditional computing architectures face fundamental limitations from data movement. Smart memory technologies address this by moving computation closer to data.

### The Data Movement Problem

In conventional systems:
- Data moves from storage to DRAM to caches to processors
- Each transfer consumes energy and time
- Memory bandwidth limits processing speed
- Von Neumann bottleneck constrains performance

### Near-Memory Processing (NMP)

Near-Memory Processing places computational elements close to memory:
- Processing units adjacent to memory arrays
- Reduced data movement distance
- Higher bandwidth between memory and compute
- Lower latency for memory-intensive operations

**Implementation approaches**:
- Logic layer in 3D-stacked memory (e.g., HBM with logic die)
- Processing elements integrated with memory controller
- Computational elements on same silicon interposer as memory

**Example: Samsung Aquabolt-XL HBM-PIM**:
- AI processing in memory with HBM2
- Performs matrix operations within memory
- Up to 2x performance improvement for AI workloads
- Minimal changes to programming model

### In-Memory Computing (IMC)

In-Memory Computing performs operations within the memory array itself:
- Uses memory device physics for computation
- Massive parallelism (entire memory array at once)
- Extremely high bandwidth and low latency
- Dramatic reduction in energy consumption

**Implementation approaches**:
- **Analog IMC**: Uses memory cell properties for computation
  - Performs matrix multiplication in a single step
  - Leverages analog current summation
  - Ideal for neural network inference

- **Digital IMC**: Adds logic to memory arrays
  - Performs bit-level operations in memory
  - Higher precision than analog approaches
  - More flexible computation

**Example: UPMEM Processing-in-Memory**:
- DRAM chips with integrated processors
- Each DIMM contains thousands of processing units
- 10-20x performance improvement for data-intensive workloads
- Specialized programming model

### Computational Storage

Computational Storage moves processing closer to persistent storage:
- Processors integrated with SSD or storage devices
- Reduces data movement across system bus
- Offloads host CPU for storage-intensive tasks
- Enables data filtering before transfer

**Implementation approaches**:
- **Computational Storage Drives (CSDs)**: SSDs with integrated processors
- **Computational Storage Processors (CSPs)**: Add-in cards that sit between storage and host
- **Computational Storage Arrays (CSAs)**: Storage arrays with distributed processing

**Example: Samsung SmartSSD**:
- SSD with integrated FPGA
- Performs data filtering, compression, encryption
- Reduces data transfer to host
- Programmable for different applications

### Programming Models for Smart Memory

Programming smart memory systems requires new approaches:
- **Domain-specific languages**: Tailored for specific smart memory architectures
- **Compiler technologies**: Automatically identify operations for offloading
- **Runtime systems**: Dynamically manage data placement and computation
- **Abstraction layers**: Hide hardware details while enabling optimization

## Persistent memory technologies and their impact

Persistent memory bridges the gap between volatile memory (DRAM) and storage (SSDs/HDDs), offering persistence with memory-like access characteristics.

### Understanding Persistent Memory

Persistent memory combines key properties:
- **Persistence**: Data survives power loss
- **Byte-addressability**: Can access individual bytes, not just blocks
- **DRAM-like performance**: Much faster than SSDs, approaching DRAM speeds
- **Higher density**: More capacity than DRAM in the same space
- **Direct load/store access**: CPU can directly access via memory instructions

### Intel Optane Persistent Memory

Intel's Optane (3D XPoint) technology was the first mainstream persistent memory product:
- DIMM form factor, plugs into memory slots
- Two operation modes:
  - **Memory Mode**: Acts as large memory with DRAM cache
  - **App Direct Mode**: Direct access as persistent memory
- Performance: ~300ns access latency (vs ~70ns for DRAM)
- Endurance: Much higher write endurance than NAND flash

### Other Persistent Memory Technologies

**Storage Class Memory (SCM) technologies**:
- **Phase Change Memory (PCM)**: Uses chalcogenide glass that changes states
- **Resistive RAM (ReRAM)**: Changes resistance of a dielectric material
- **Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM)**: Uses magnetic states for storage
- **Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM)**: Uses ferroelectric polarization

### Programming for Persistent Memory

Persistent memory requires special programming considerations:
- **Persistence guarantees**: Ensuring writes actually reach persistent media
- **Crash consistency**: Maintaining data structures across power failures
- **Ordering**: Managing the order of persistent operations
- **Atomicity**: Ensuring operations complete fully or not at all

**Example using PMDK (Persistent Memory Development Kit)**:

```c
#include <libpmemobj.h>

/* Define a simple persistent structure */
POBJ_LAYOUT_BEGIN(example);
POBJ_LAYOUT_ROOT(example, struct my_root);
POBJ_LAYOUT_TOID(example, struct my_data);
POBJ_LAYOUT_END(example);

struct my_data {
    int value;
};

struct my_root {
    TOID(struct my_data) data;
};

int main() {
    PMEMobjpool *pop = pmemobj_open("/mnt/pmem/example", LAYOUT_NAME);
    
    TOID(struct my_root) root = POBJ_ROOT(pop, struct my_root);
    
    /* Atomic transaction to update data */
    TX_BEGIN(pop) {
        TOID(struct my_data) data = TX_ALLOC(struct my_data, sizeof(struct my_data));
        D_RW(data)->value = 42;
        TX_ADD(root);
        D_RW(root)->data = data;
    } TX_END
    
    pmemobj_close(pop);
    return 0;
}
```

### Impact on Accelerated Computing

Persistent memory offers several benefits for accelerated systems:
- **Larger memory capacity**: Extending beyond DRAM limitations
- **Checkpoint/restart**: Fast saving of application state
- **Memory tiering**: Using as an intermediate tier between DRAM and storage
- **Reduced data movement**: Keeping data persistent in memory hierarchy
- **In-memory databases**: Maintaining large databases directly in memory

**Use cases in accelerated computing**:
- AI model persistence and quick loading
- Large graph analytics without storage I/O
- Checkpointing long-running simulations
- Memory extension for large dataset processing

## Optimizing memory access patterns for acceleration

Memory access patterns dramatically impact performance in accelerated systems. Optimizing these patterns is often as important as optimizing computation.

### Common Memory Access Patterns

**Sequential Access**:
- Accessing memory in consecutive addresses
- Ideal for prefetching and caching
- Maximizes bandwidth utilization
- Example: Array traversal, stream processing

**Strided Access**:
- Accessing memory with a fixed interval between elements
- Common in matrix operations (accessing columns)
- Can cause cache thrashing if stride matches cache line size
- Example: Accessing matrix columns in row-major storage

**Random Access**:
- Unpredictable memory access patterns
- Difficult to prefetch or cache effectively
- Limited by memory latency rather than bandwidth
- Example: Graph traversal, hash table lookups

**Gather/Scatter**:
- Gathering data from multiple locations into contiguous storage
- Scattering data from contiguous storage to multiple locations
- Common in sparse operations and irregular data structures
- Example: Sparse matrix operations, particle simulations

### Memory Optimization Techniques

**Data Layout Optimization**:
- Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) vs. Array-of-Structures (AoS)
- Aligning data to cache line boundaries
- Padding to avoid false sharing
- Tiling/blocking for cache locality

**Example: AoS vs. SoA**:
```c
// Array of Structures (AoS) - Poor for SIMD/vector processing
struct Particle {
    float x, y, z;    // Position
    float vx, vy, vz; // Velocity
};
Particle particles[NUM_PARTICLES];

// Structure of Arrays (SoA) - Better for SIMD/vector processing
struct ParticleSystem {
    float x[NUM_PARTICLES], y[NUM_PARTICLES], z[NUM_PARTICLES];    // Positions
    float vx[NUM_PARTICLES], vy[NUM_PARTICLES], vz[NUM_PARTICLES]; // Velocities
};
```

**Prefetching**:
- Hardware prefetching: Automatic by the processor
- Software prefetching: Explicit prefetch instructions
- Asynchronous data loading: Preparing data before needed

**Example: Software Prefetching**:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    // Prefetch data that will be needed in future iterations
    __builtin_prefetch(&data[i + 16], 0, 3);
    
    // Process current data
    process(data[i]);
}
```

**Memory Coalescing (for GPUs)**:
- Ensuring threads in a warp/wavefront access contiguous memory
- Critical for achieving full memory bandwidth on GPUs
- Aligning access patterns to hardware capabilities

**Example: Coalesced vs. Non-coalesced Access**:
```cuda
// Non-coalesced access (poor performance)
__global__ void badKernel(float* data, int width, int height) {
    int x = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    int y = threadIdx.y + blockIdx.y * blockDim.y;
    
    if (x < width && y < height)
        data[y + x * height] = 1.0f; // Column-major access
}

// Coalesced access (good performance)
__global__ void goodKernel(float* data, int width, int height) {
    int x = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    int y = threadIdx.y + blockIdx.y * blockDim.y;
    
    if (x < width && y < height)
        data[x + y * width] = 1.0f; // Row-major access
}
```

**Memory Tiling/Blocking**:
- Breaking large problems into cache-friendly tiles
- Improving data reuse within cache
- Reducing capacity misses

**Example: Matrix Multiplication Tiling**:
```c
// Naive matrix multiplication (poor cache usage)
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++)
            C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];

// Tiled matrix multiplication (better cache usage)
for (int i0 = 0; i0 < N; i0 += TILE)
    for (int j0 = 0; j0 < N; j0 += TILE)
        for (int k0 = 0; k0 < N; k0 += TILE)
            for (int i = i0; i < min(i0+TILE, N); i++)
                for (int j = j0; j < min(j0+TILE, N); j++)
                    for (int k = k0; k < min(k0+TILE, N); k++)
                        C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
```

### Accelerator-Specific Optimizations

**GPU Memory Optimizations**:
- Using shared memory for data reuse
- Texture memory for spatially local access patterns
- Constant memory for broadcast values
- Register blocking to reduce memory accesses

**FPGA Memory Optimizations**:
- Custom memory hierarchies for specific algorithms
- Pipeline parallelism with distributed memory
- Memory banking to increase bandwidth
- Dataflow architectures to minimize memory access

**ASIC Memory Optimizations**:
- Application-specific memory hierarchies
- Custom caching policies
- Specialized data paths for common patterns
- Scratchpad memories for predictable access patterns

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"More bandwidth always means better performance"**: While bandwidth is important, many applications are limited by latency or access patterns rather than raw bandwidth.

2. **"HBM is always better than GDDR"**: HBM offers higher bandwidth but at higher cost and complexity. For many applications, GDDR provides sufficient bandwidth at lower cost.

3. **"Unified memory eliminates the need to think about data placement"**: While unified memory simplifies programming, understanding and optimizing data placement remains critical for performance.

4. **"Persistent memory can replace DRAM"**: Current persistent memory technologies have higher latency than DRAM, making them complementary rather than replacement technologies.

5. **"Memory optimization is less important than computational optimization"**: For many accelerated workloads, memory access is the primary bottleneck, making memory optimization more impactful than computational optimization.

## Try It Yourself: Memory Access Pattern Analysis

### Exercise 1: Measuring the Impact of Memory Access Patterns

This simple C++ program demonstrates the performance impact of different memory access patterns:

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int SIZE = 10000;
const int ITERATIONS = 1000;

// Sequential access pattern
void sequentialAccess(std::vector<int>& data) {
    for (int iter = 0; iter < ITERATIONS; iter++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            data[i] += 1;
        }
    }
}

// Random access pattern
void randomAccess(std::vector<int>& data, std::vector<int>& indices) {
    for (int iter = 0; iter < ITERATIONS; iter++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            data[indices[i]] += 1;
        }
    }
}

// Strided access pattern
void stridedAccess(std::vector<int>& data, int stride) {
    for (int iter = 0; iter < ITERATIONS; iter++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            data[(i * stride) % SIZE] += 1;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data(SIZE, 0);
    
    // Create random indices for random access
    std::vector<int> indices(SIZE);
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
        indices[i] = rand() % SIZE;
    }
    
    // Measure sequential access time
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    sequentialAccess(data);
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> sequential_time = end - start;
    
    // Measure random access time
    start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    randomAccess(data, indices);
    end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> random_time = end - start;
    
    // Measure strided access time (with stride of 16)
    start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    stridedAccess(data, 16);
    end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> strided_time = end - start;
    
    std::cout << "Sequential access time: " << sequential_time.count() << " ms\n";
    std::cout << "Random access time: " << random_time.count() << " ms\n";
    std::cout << "Strided access time: " << strided_time.count() << " ms\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Tasks**:
1. Compile and run this program
2. Experiment with different array sizes and stride values
3. Observe the performance differences between access patterns
4. Try to explain the results based on cache behavior

### Exercise 2: AoS vs. SoA Performance Comparison

This exercise compares Array-of-Structures (AoS) and Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) data layouts:

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

const int NUM_PARTICLES = 1000000;
const int ITERATIONS = 100;

// Array of Structures layout
struct ParticleAoS {
    float x, y, z;        // Position
    float vx, vy, vz;     // Velocity
};

// Structure of Arrays layout
struct ParticleSystemSoA {
    std::vector<float> x, y, z;    // Positions
    std::vector<float> vx, vy, vz; // Velocities
    
    ParticleSystemSoA(int size) : 
        x(size), y(size), z(size),
        vx(size), vy(size), vz(size) {}
};

// Update particles using AoS layout
void updateAoS(std::vector<ParticleAoS>& particles) {
    for (int iter = 0; iter < ITERATIONS; iter++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < particles.size(); i++) {
            particles[i].x += particles[i].vx;
            particles[i].y += particles[i].vy;
            particles[i].z += particles[i].vz;
        }
    }
}

// Update particles using SoA layout
void updateSoA(ParticleSystemSoA& particles) {
    for (int iter = 0; iter < ITERATIONS; iter++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < particles.x.size(); i++) {
            particles.x[i] += particles.vx[i];
            particles.y[i] += particles.vy[i];
            particles.z[i] += particles.vz[i];
        }
