## Code Snippets

### Example 1: Adding CUDA Error Checking
```cpp
// Original code without error checking
cudaMalloc(&d_data, size);
kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_data);
cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

// With proper error checking
#define CUDA_CHECK(call) \
    do { \
        cudaError_t err = call; \
        if (err != cudaSuccess) { \
            printf("CUDA error in %s at line %d: %s\n", \
                   __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err)); \
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE); \
        } \
    } while(0)

CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_data, size));
kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_data);
CUDA_CHECK(cudaGetLastError()); // Check for launch errors
CUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize()); // Check for execution errors
CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost));
```

### Example 2: Adding Profiling Markers
```cpp
// Original code without markers
preprocess_data(input);
launch_computation();
postprocess_results();

// With NVTX markers for better profiling
#include <nvtx3/nvToolsExt.h>

nvtxRangePush("Data Preprocessing");
preprocess_data(input);
nvtxRangePop();

nvtxRangePush("Main Computation");
launch_computation();
nvtxRangePop();

nvtxRangePush("Result Postprocessing");
postprocess_results();
nvtxRangePop();
```

### Example 3: Memory Access Pattern Debugging
```cpp
// Potentially inefficient memory access pattern
__global__ void inefficientKernel(float* data, int width, int height) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int idy = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    
    if (idx < width && idy < height) {
        // Column-major access pattern can cause uncoalesced memory access on GPUs
        float value = data[idx * height + idy];
        // Process value...
    }
}

// Improved memory access pattern
__global__ void efficientKernel(float* data, int width, int height) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int idy = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    
    if (idx < width && idy < height) {
        // Row-major access pattern for better coalescing
        float value = data[idy * width + idx];
        // Process value...
    }
}
```

## Try It Yourself Exercises

1. **Error Injection and Debugging**:
   Deliberately introduce common errors (race conditions, out-of-bounds access) into a CUDA program and use debugging tools to identify and fix them.

2. **Performance Profiling Practice**:
   Take a simple GPU kernel and use profiling tools to identify its performance bottleneck. Then optimize the kernel and measure the improvement.

3. **Memory Access Pattern Analysis**:
   Implement the same algorithm with different memory access patterns and use profiling tools to visualize and compare their performance characteristics.

4. **Power Profiling Experiment**:
   Profile the power consumption of a GPU application under different workloads and optimization levels, then identify strategies to improve power efficiency.

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"Debugging GPU code is impossible"**
   - Reality: While more challenging than CPU debugging, modern tools provide significant visibility into GPU execution.

2. **"Profilers add too much overhead to be useful"**
   - Reality: Many profiling tools have minimal impact modes or sampling approaches that reduce overhead.

3. **"Memory errors always cause immediate crashes"**
   - Reality: Some memory errors, especially on GPUs, may cause subtle corruption or performance issues without crashing.

4. **"The fastest kernel is always the most efficient"**
   - Reality: Power consumption, thermal considerations, and system-wide effects must be considered for true efficiency.

## Real-World Applications

1. **Deep Learning Framework Optimization**:
   Profiling and optimizing training performance in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

2. **Scientific Computing**:
   Debugging complex numerical simulations running on supercomputer accelerators.

3. **Real-time Graphics**:
   Profiling and optimizing game engines to maintain consistent frame rates on various GPU hardware.

4. **Financial Modeling**:
   Ensuring correctness and performance of high-frequency trading algorithms on accelerators.
