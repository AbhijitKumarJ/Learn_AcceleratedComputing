## Key Terminology
- **Qubit**: The fundamental unit of quantum information
- **Superposition**: The ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states simultaneously
- **Entanglement**: Quantum correlation between particles that cannot be described independently
- **Quantum Gate**: The basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits
- **Quantum Circuit**: A sequence of quantum gates to perform quantum computation
- **Decoherence**: Loss of quantum information due to interaction with the environment
- **NISQ**: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum, referring to current quantum computers
- **Quantum Advantage**: The point where quantum computers solve problems faster than classical computers

## Practical Exercise
Implement a simple quantum algorithm (e.g., Deutsch-Jozsa or Bernstein-Vazirani) using a quantum computing framework like Qiskit or Cirq:
1. Design the quantum circuit
2. Simulate the execution on a classical computer
3. Run the algorithm on a real quantum processor (via cloud access)
4. Compare results between simulation and real hardware
5. Analyze the impact of noise and errors on the results

## Common Misconceptions
- "Quantum computers will speed up all types of computation" - They provide advantages only for specific problem classes
- "Quantum computers are just faster classical computers" - They operate on fundamentally different principles
- "Quantum computers will break all encryption immediately when available" - Practical cryptographically-relevant quantum computers are still years away
- "Current quantum computers can already solve practical problems better than classical computers" - Most are still in the NISQ era with limited practical applications

## Real-world Applications
- Quantum chemistry simulations for drug discovery and materials science
- Optimization problems in logistics, finance, and energy
- Cryptography and security applications
- Machine learning for pattern recognition and data analysis
- Financial modeling and risk analysis
- Traffic flow optimization and transportation planning
