## Code Snippets

### Example 1: Using Compiler Directives for GPU Optimization
```cpp
// Original code
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j];
    }
}

// With OpenMP target directives
#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for collapse(2)
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j];
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Loop Tiling for Better Cache Utilization
```cpp
// Original code
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
            C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        }
    }
}

// Tiled version for better cache locality
#define TILE_SIZE 32
for (int i = 0; i < N; i += TILE_SIZE) {
    for (int j = 0; j < N; j += TILE_SIZE) {
        for (int k = 0; k < N; k += TILE_SIZE) {
            // Tile loops
            for (int ii = i; ii < min(i + TILE_SIZE, N); ii++) {
                for (int jj = j; jj < min(j + TILE_SIZE, N); jj++) {
                    for (int kk = k; kk < min(k + TILE_SIZE, N); kk++) {
                        C[ii][jj] += A[ii][kk] * B[kk][jj];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Try It Yourself Exercises

1. **Compiler Explorer Investigation**:
   Use the Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org) to examine how different compiler flags affect the generated assembly for a simple vector addition kernel.

2. **Loop Transformation Practice**:
   Take a nested loop algorithm and apply manual loop tiling, then compare performance with the original version on both CPU and GPU.

3. **OpenMP Directive Exploration**:
   Experiment with different OpenMP directives to parallelize a computation and observe how they translate to different hardware targets.

4. **Domain-Specific Compiler Experiment**:
   Implement a simple neural network operation using both raw CUDA and a domain-specific compiler like XLA or TVM, then compare the performance and development effort.

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"Compiler optimizations always improve performance"**
   - Reality: Some optimizations may help in certain scenarios but hurt in others, especially with complex accelerator architectures.

2. **"Manual optimization is always better than compiler optimization"**
   - Reality: Modern compilers often generate better code than manual optimization for many common patterns, especially as hardware evolves.

3. **"One compilation strategy works for all accelerators"**
   - Reality: Different accelerators benefit from different optimization strategies, and compilers need target-specific knowledge.

4. **"Auto-vectorization will always utilize SIMD units effectively"**
   - Reality: Complex control flow, memory access patterns, and data dependencies can limit the compiler's ability to vectorize code.

## Real-World Applications

1. **Deep Learning Frameworks**:
   TensorFlow and PyTorch use XLA and TorchScript respectively to optimize computational graphs for various accelerators.

2. **High-Performance Computing**:
   Weather simulation codes use polyhedral optimization to efficiently utilize supercomputer accelerators.

3. **Real-time Graphics**:
   Game engines use specialized shader compilers to optimize rendering code for different GPU architectures.

4. **Financial Modeling**:
   Option pricing models use JIT compilation to generate optimized code for Monte Carlo simulations on GPUs.
