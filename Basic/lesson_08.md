## Try It Yourself: Simple AVX Vector Addition
```cpp
#include <immintrin.h>
#include <iostream>

void avx_vector_add(float* a, float* b, float* c, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 8) {
        // Load 8 floats from arrays a and b
        __m256 va = _mm256_loadu_ps(&a[i]);
        __m256 vb = _mm256_loadu_ps(&b[i]);
        
        // Add the vectors
        __m256 vc = _mm256_add_ps(va, vb);
        
        // Store the result in array c
        _mm256_storeu_ps(&c[i], vc);
    }
}

int main() {
    const int size = 1024;
    float a[size], b[size], c[size];
    
    // Initialize arrays
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        a[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
        b[i] = static_cast<float>(i * 2);
    }
    
    // Perform AVX vector addition
    avx_vector_add(a, b, c, size);
    
    // Verify results (just checking a few values)
    std::cout << "c[0] = " << c[0] << " (expected: " << a[0] + b[0] << ")" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "c[10] = " << c[10] << " (expected: " << a[10] + b[10] << ")" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "c[100] = " << c[100] << " (expected: " << a[100] + b[100] << ")" << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Real-World Application Example
**Intel-Optimized AI Inference**

Intel's OpenVINO toolkit leverages both CPU (via AVX) and GPU acceleration to optimize AI inference workloads:

```python
# Example of using OpenVINO with Intel acceleration
from openvino.inference_engine import IECore

# Initialize the Inference Engine
ie = IECore()

# Read the network from an IR file
net = ie.read_network(model="face_detection.xml", weights="face_detection.bin")

# Prepare input and output blobs
input_blob = next(iter(net.input_info))
output_blob = next(iter(net.outputs))

# Load the network to the device (CPU with AVX, GPU, or both)
# "AUTO" will select the best available device
exec_net = ie.load_network(network=net, device_name="AUTO")

# Prepare input
input_data = prepare_image("person.jpg")

# Run inference
result = exec_net.infer(inputs={input_blob: input_data})

# Process results
detections = result[output_blob]
```
