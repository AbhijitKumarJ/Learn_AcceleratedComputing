# Lesson 12: Heterogeneous Computing Systems

## What is Heterogeneous Computing?

Heterogeneous computing refers to systems that use more than one kind of processor or core. Instead of relying solely on CPUs, these systems integrate different types of processing elements—such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and specialized accelerators—each optimized for specific types of tasks. This approach allows the system to assign workloads to the most appropriate processor, maximizing both performance and energy efficiency.

Think of heterogeneous computing like a specialized team where each member has unique skills. Rather than having generalists do everything, you assign tasks to specialists who can complete them more efficiently.

## Combining CPUs, GPUs, and Other Accelerators Effectively

A well-designed heterogeneous system leverages the strengths of each component:

- **CPUs**: Handle sequential tasks, operating system functions, and control flow
- **GPUs**: Process highly parallel workloads like graphics rendering and matrix operations
- **FPGAs**: Perform custom-designed hardware acceleration for specific algorithms
- **ASICs/NPUs**: Execute specialized functions like AI inference with maximum efficiency

The key to effective combination is workload partitioning—breaking down applications into components that match the strengths of each accelerator. For example, in a machine learning pipeline, the CPU might handle data preprocessing and orchestration, while the GPU trains the model, and a specialized NPU runs the inference in production.

## The Data Movement Challenge: Avoiding Bottlenecks

One of the biggest challenges in heterogeneous computing is data movement. Moving data between different processors can become a significant bottleneck, sometimes negating the performance benefits of specialized accelerators.

```
CPU Memory → GPU Memory → FPGA → CPU Memory
```

Each transfer in this chain introduces latency and consumes power. Strategies to mitigate this include:

- **Data locality**: Keeping data close to where it's processed
- **Minimizing transfers**: Processing as much as possible before moving data
- **Overlapping computation and communication**: Transferring the next batch of data while processing the current one
- **Using unified memory architectures**: Where supported, allowing different processors to access the same memory space

## Task Scheduling Across Different Processor Types

Effective task scheduling in heterogeneous systems requires understanding:

1. **Task characteristics**: Is the task sequential or parallel? Memory-intensive or compute-intensive?
2. **Processor capabilities**: Which processor is best suited for each task type?
3. **Dependencies**: What tasks must complete before others can begin?
4. **Current system load**: Which processors are available or already busy?

Modern heterogeneous frameworks like OpenCL, CUDA, and oneAPI provide tools for expressing these relationships and managing task distribution. At a higher level, frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can automatically distribute machine learning workloads across available accelerators.

## Memory Coherence Explained Simply

Memory coherence refers to ensuring that all processors in a system see a consistent view of shared memory. This becomes complex in heterogeneous systems where different processors may have their own memory spaces and caching mechanisms.

Consider this scenario:
1. CPU updates a value in memory
2. GPU reads the same memory location
3. Without proper coherence, the GPU might see an outdated value

Solutions include:
- **Explicit synchronization**: Programmers manually ensure data is consistent before access
- **Hardware coherence protocols**: Automatic mechanisms that track and update shared data
- **Unified memory systems**: Providing a single view of memory across processors

## Power Management in Heterogeneous Systems

Heterogeneous systems offer unique opportunities for power efficiency:

- **Right-sizing**: Using the minimum necessary processing power for each task
- **Dynamic scaling**: Activating accelerators only when needed
- **Specialized efficiency**: Using processors designed for energy efficiency in specific workloads

Modern systems employ sophisticated power management techniques:
- Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)
- Selective power-gating of unused components
- Workload-aware scheduling that considers energy usage

- GPU clusters for AI training and HPC workloads
- FPGA arrays for networking and specialized acceleration
- Custom AI accelerators (like Google's TPUs) for machine learning

## Design Considerations for Mixed Accelerator Workloads

When designing applications for heterogeneous systems, consider:

1. **Workload partitioning**: Identify which parts of your application benefit from which accelerator
2. **Data flow optimization**: Minimize data movement between processing elements
3. **Load balancing**: Ensure no single component becomes a bottleneck
4. **Fallback mechanisms**: Provide alternatives when specific accelerators are unavailable
5. **Programming model selection**: Choose frameworks that support your target accelerators
6. **Testing and profiling**: Verify performance gains across different hardware configurations

## Key Terminology

- **Heterogeneous Computing**: Computing systems that use multiple processor types
- **Data Locality**: Keeping data close to where it will be processed
- **Memory Coherence**: Ensuring consistent views of memory across different processors
- **Task Scheduling**: Assigning computational tasks to appropriate processors
- **Workload Partitioning**: Dividing applications into components suited for different accelerators

## Common Misconceptions

- **Misconception**: Adding more accelerators always improves performance.
  **Reality**: Without proper workload distribution and data movement optimization, additional accelerators may not help or could even decrease performance.

- **Misconception**: Heterogeneous programming is always much more complex than homogeneous programming.
  **Reality**: Modern frameworks and libraries increasingly abstract the complexity, though understanding the underlying principles remains important.

## Try It Yourself: Simple Heterogeneous Computing Exercise

1. What different types of processing might be happening
2. Which parts would benefit from CPU processing
3. Which parts would benefit from GPU acceleration
4. What specialized accelerators might further improve performance
