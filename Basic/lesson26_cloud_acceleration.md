## Code Snippets

### Example 1: Provisioning a GPU Instance on AWS with Boto3
```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

# Launch a p3.2xlarge instance with NVIDIA V100 GPU
instances = ec2.create_instances(
    ImageId='ami-0123456789abcdef0',  # Deep Learning AMI
    MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1,
    InstanceType='p3.2xlarge',
    KeyName='my-key-pair',
    SecurityGroupIds=['sg-0123456789abcdef0'],
    BlockDeviceMappings=[
        {
            'DeviceName': '/dev/sda1',
            'Ebs': {
                'VolumeSize': 100,
                'VolumeType': 'gp2'
            }
        }
    ],
    TagSpecifications=[
        {
            'ResourceType': 'instance',
            'Tags': [
                {
                    'Key': 'Name',
                    'Value': 'GPU-Workload'
                },

FROM nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu20.04

# Install Python and pip
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support
RUN pip3 install torch==1.13.0+cu116 torchvision==0.14.0+cu116 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116/torch_stable.html

# Copy application code
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Set environment variables
ENV NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES all
ENV NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES compute,utility

# Run the application
CMD ["python3", "train.py"]
```

## Try It Yourself Exercises

1. **Cloud Provider Comparison**:
   Set up equivalent GPU instances on two different cloud providers, run the same benchmark, and compare performance and cost.

2. **Spot Instance Strategy**:
   Implement a system that can checkpoint and resume GPU workloads to take advantage of spot/preemptible instances.

3. **Container Orchestration**:
   Create a Kubernetes deployment that automatically scales GPU nodes based on pending workloads.

4. **Hybrid Deployment**:
   Design and implement a machine learning workflow where model training happens in the cloud and inference runs on an edge device.

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"Cloud GPUs are always more expensive than on-premises"**
   - Reality: When accounting for power, cooling, maintenance, and utilization rates, cloud can often be more cost-effective, especially for variable workloads.

2. **"All cloud GPU instances offer the same performance"**
   - Reality: Performance varies significantly across providers, instance types, and even within the same instance family due to underlying hardware differences.

3. **"Moving to cloud acceleration is just a lift-and-shift operation"**
   - Reality: Effective cloud acceleration often requires rearchitecting applications to leverage cloud-native services and handle elasticity.

4. **"Serverless can't handle GPU workloads"**
   - Reality: Many providers now offer GPU-accelerated serverless options, though with certain constraints and considerations.

## Real-World Applications

1. **AI Research**:
   Research teams using cloud GPUs to train large models without capital investment in hardware.

2. **Media Processing**:
   Video streaming services using cloud GPUs for real-time transcoding during peak demand periods.

3. **Financial Modeling**:
   Investment firms using cloud accelerators for Monte Carlo simulations during market hours and scaling down afterward.

4. **Drug Discovery**:
   Pharmaceutical companies using cloud TPUs for molecular dynamics simulations with burst capacity needs.
