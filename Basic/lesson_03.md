In this lesson, we'll explore Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), their unique architectural design, and how they've evolved from specialized graphics chips to powerful general-purpose computing accelerators. We'll also introduce the fundamental concepts of GPU programming models that enable developers to harness their massive parallel processing capabilities.

## The Evolution of GPUs: From Graphics to General Computing

GPUs have undergone a remarkable transformation over the past few decades:

### The Graphics-Only Era (1990s-early 2000s)
- Initially designed solely for rendering images and video
- Fixed-function pipelines for specific graphics operations
- Programmability limited to small "shader" programs
- Specialized for triangle manipulation, texture mapping, and pixel operations
- Examples: NVIDIA GeForce 256, ATI Radeon 7000

### The Programmable Shader Era (early-mid 2000s)
- Introduction of programmable vertex and pixel shaders
- Graphics pipeline became more flexible
- Still primarily focused on graphics workloads
- Limited by specialized programming interfaces
- Examples: NVIDIA GeForce FX, ATI Radeon 9700

### The GPGPU Revolution (late 2000s-2010s)
- **G**eneral **P**urpose computing on **G**raphics **P**rocessing **U**nits
- Introduction of compute-focused programming models (CUDA, OpenCL)
- Unified shader architecture allowing more flexible computation
- Addition of features specifically for non-graphics computation
- Examples: NVIDIA Tesla, AMD FireStream

### The Modern Compute GPU Era (2010s-present)

## Fundamental GPU Architecture

To understand what makes GPUs unique, let's examine their core architectural principles:

### The Parallel Processing Paradigm
- GPUs are designed for throughput rather than latency
- Thousands of simple cores instead of few complex cores
- Optimized for executing the same instruction across many data elements
- Massive thread parallelism to hide memory latency

### Core GPU Components
1. **Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)** or **Compute Units (CUs)**
   - The fundamental building blocks of GPU computation
   - Each contains multiple execution units, schedulers, and local memory
   - Modern GPUs contain dozens to hundreds of SMs/CUs

2. **CUDA Cores / Stream Processors**
   - Individual execution units within each SM/CU
   - Specialized for different operations (integer, floating-point, tensor, etc.)
   - Simpler than CPU cores but far more numerous

3. **Memory Hierarchy**
   - **Global Memory**: Large but relatively high-latency VRAM (Video RAM)
   - **Shared Memory/L1 Cache**: Fast memory shared within an SM/CU
   - **Registers**: Ultra-fast per-thread storage
   - **Texture/Constant Caches**: Specialized for specific access patterns

4. **Special Function Units (SFUs)**
   - Hardware for transcendental functions (sin, cos, exp, etc.)
   - Tensor cores for matrix operations
   - Ray tracing cores for intersection calculations

5. **Memory Controllers**
   - Wide memory interfaces (256-bit to 6144-bit)
   - High bandwidth optimized for parallel access patterns
   - Modern HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) providing TB/s of bandwidth

![Diagram: Basic GPU architecture showing SMs/CUs, memory hierarchy, and interconnects]

## The SIMT Execution Model

GPUs operate on a principle called **Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT)**, which is key to understanding their performance characteristics:

### SIMT Fundamentals
- Groups of threads (typically 32 or 64) execute the same instruction in lockstep
- These groups are called **warps** (NVIDIA) or **wavefronts** (AMD)
- Each thread operates on different data elements
- Divergent execution paths within a warp cause serialization

### Thread Hierarchy
- **Threads**: Individual execution instances
- **Blocks/Workgroups**: Collections of threads that can synchronize and share memory
- **Grid/NDRange**: The entire computation consisting of multiple blocks

### Execution Scheduling
- Hardware thread schedulers manage thousands of threads simultaneously
- Zero-cost thread switching hides memory latency
- Occupancy (active threads per SM) affects performance
- Warp scheduling policies optimize for throughput

> **Analogy**: If a CPU is like a few master chefs working independently on complex dishes, a GPU is like an assembly line of hundreds of specialized workers each performing the same simple task on different ingredients. The assembly line might take longer to prepare a single dish, but can produce hundreds of dishes in parallel.

![Diagram: SIMT execution model showing warp/wavefront organization and thread hierarchy]

## Memory Architecture and Optimization

GPU memory architecture is fundamentally different from CPU memory systems, optimized for bandwidth over latency:

### Memory Bandwidth vs. Latency
- GPUs prioritize high bandwidth (up to 3 TB/s in modern designs)
- Memory latency is high (hundreds of cycles) but hidden by thread parallelism
- Coalesced memory access patterns are critical for performance

### Memory Access Patterns
- **Coalesced Access**: When threads in a warp access adjacent memory locations
- **Strided Access**: Regular but non-adjacent access patterns
- **Random Access**: Unpredictable memory locations (poorest performance)
- **Texture Access**: Spatially local 2D/3D access with hardware acceleration

### Memory Optimization Techniques
- **Shared Memory Usage**: Explicitly managed scratchpad for data reuse
- **Memory Tiling**: Reorganizing data access for better locality
- **Texture Memory**: Using specialized caches for specific access patterns
- **Constant Memory**: For read-only data accessed by all threads
- **Register Pressure Management**: Balancing variable usage to maximize occupancy

### Unified Memory and Modern Approaches
- Automatic memory management between CPU and GPU
- Page migration based on access patterns
- Hardware-based coherence mechanisms
- NVLink and similar technologies for high-speed CPU-GPU communication

![Diagram: GPU memory hierarchy showing bandwidth and latency characteristics at each level]

## GPU Programming Models

Several programming models have emerged to harness GPU computing power:

### CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
- NVIDIA's proprietary GPU computing platform
- C/C++ language extension with GPU-specific constructs
- Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools
- Offers the most direct access to NVIDIA GPU capabilities

      int i = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;
      if (i < n) {
          C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
      }
  }
  
  // Host code
  vectorAdd<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, n);
  ```

### OpenCL (Open Computing Language)
- Open standard for heterogeneous computing
- Supports GPUs from multiple vendors, as well as CPUs and other accelerators
- More verbose than CUDA but more portable
- Kernel example:
  ```c
  __kernel void vectorAdd(__global const float* A, 
                         __global const float* B, 
                         __global float* C, 
                         int n) {
      int i = get_global_id(0);
      if (i < n) {
          C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
      }
  }
  ```

## GPU Performance Considerations

Achieving optimal GPU performance requires understanding several key factors:

### Compute Bound vs. Memory Bound

## Try It Yourself: GPU Programming Concepts

Let's practice understanding GPU programming concepts:

### Exercise 1: Parallelization Analysis
For each problem below, determine if it's well-suited for GPU acceleration and why:

1. Sorting a list of 1 million integers
2. Parsing a complex XML document
3. Matrix multiplication of two 4096×4096 matrices
4. Pathfinding in a graph with complex decision logic
5. Image processing applying the same filter to each pixel

### Solutions:
1. **Sorting**: Moderately suitable - parallel algorithms exist but require careful implementation due to interdependencies
2. **XML parsing**: Poorly suited - highly sequential with irregular control flow and dependencies
3. **Matrix multiplication**: Excellent fit - highly parallel with regular memory access patterns
4. **Complex pathfinding**: Generally poor fit - irregular memory access and control flow, though some algorithms can be parallelized
5. **Image filtering**: Excellent fit - each pixel can be processed independently with good locality

### Exercise 2: CUDA Kernel Analysis
Examine this CUDA kernel and identify potential performance issues:

```cuda
__global__ void processArray(float* input, float* output, int n) {
    int i = threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        if (input[i] > 0) {
            for (int j = 0; j < input[i]; j++) {
                sum += sqrt(j);
            }
        } else {
            sum = input[i];
        }
        output[i] = sum;
    }
}

// Host code
processArray<<<1, 256>>>(d_input, d_output, 1000);
```

### Solution:
1. **Indexing issue**: Uses only threadIdx.x, limiting to 1024 elements maximum
2. **Thread divergence**: The if/else creates divergent paths within warps
3. **Load imbalance**: Threads do different amounts of work based on input values
4. **Inefficient launch configuration**: Single block limits parallelism
5. **Uncoalesced memory access**: Not using blockIdx.x means threads aren't accessing adjacent memory

Improved version:
```cuda
__global__ void processArray(float* input, float* output, int n) {
    int i = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        float val = input[i];
        if (val > 0) {
            // Pre-compute to avoid thread divergence in loop
            sum = val > 1000 ? 1000 : val; // Limit work to balance load
            // Further optimizations possible
        } else {
            sum = val;
        }
        output[i] = sum;
    }
}

// Host code
int threadsPerBlock = 256;
int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
processArray<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_input, d_output, n);
```
