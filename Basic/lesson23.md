## Key Terminology
- **RAPIDS**: NVIDIA's suite of open-source software libraries for executing data science pipelines entirely on GPUs
- **cuDF**: GPU DataFrame library providing a Pandas-like API
- **cuML**: Collection of GPU-accelerated machine learning algorithms
- **ETL**: Extract, Transform, Load - the process of preparing data for analysis
- **In-Memory Analytics**: Performing analytics on data stored in RAM rather than disk
- **Graph Analytics**: Analysis of relationships between entities represented as nodes and edges
- **Time Series**: Data points indexed in time order, often requiring specialized analysis methods
- **Visual Analytics**: The science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces

## Practical Exercise
Implement an accelerated data science pipeline that:
1. Loads a large dataset (>1GB) into GPU memory
2. Performs data cleaning and preprocessing operations
3. Trains a machine learning model using GPU acceleration
4. Evaluates model performance
5. Visualizes results using GPU-accelerated visualization
6. Compare performance with a traditional CPU-based workflow

## Common Misconceptions
- "GPUs only accelerate deep learning, not traditional data science" - Modern frameworks enable acceleration across the entire data science workflow
- "Accelerated data science requires completely rewriting existing code" - Many frameworks provide drop-in replacements with familiar APIs
- "Small datasets don't benefit from acceleration" - Even with smaller data, complex algorithms can see significant speedups
- "GPU-accelerated data science is only for specialized applications" - It's becoming mainstream across many industries and use cases

## Real-world Applications
