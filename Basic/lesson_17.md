  - Memory-bound (limited by memory bandwidth)
  - Compute-bound (limited by computational throughput)

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Throughput needs (operations per second)
  - Latency constraints (response time requirements)
  - Batch vs. real-time processing
  - Scale of data being processed

- **Domain-Specific Considerations**:
  - AI/ML: Training vs. inference requirements
  - Scientific computing: Precision requirements
  - Graphics: Rendering quality and frame rate needs
  - Data analytics: Query complexity and data volume

### Audit Existing Systems

    cpu_percentages = []
    for _ in range(duration):
        cpu_percentages.append(psutil.cpu_percent(interval=interval))
    return {
        "average": sum(cpu_percentages) / len(cpu_percentages),
        "max": max(cpu_percentages),
        "min": min(cpu_percentages)
    }

# Memory utilization
def monitor_memory(duration=60, interval=1):
    memory_percentages = []
    for _ in range(duration):
        memory_percentages.append(psutil.virtual_memory().percent)
        time.sleep(interval)
    return {
        "average": sum(memory_percentages) / len(memory_percentages),
        "max": max(memory_percentages),
        "min": min(memory_percentages)
    }

# GPU utilization (if available)
def monitor_gpu(duration=60, interval=1):
    if not GPUtil.getGPUs():
        return "No GPUs detected"
    
    gpu_utilization = []
    gpu_memory = []
    for _ in range(duration):
        gpus = GPUtil.getGPUs()
        gpu_utilization.append(sum(gpu.load for gpu in gpus) / len(gpus))
        gpu_memory.append(sum(gpu.memoryUtil for gpu in gpus) / len(gpus))
        time.sleep(interval)
    
    return {
        "utilization": {
            "average": sum(gpu_utilization) / len(gpu_utilization),
            "max": max(gpu_utilization),
            "min": min(gpu_utilization)
        },
        "memory": {
            "average": sum(gpu_memory) / len(gpu_memory),
            "max": max(gpu_memory),
            "min": min(gpu_memory)
        }
    }

# Run monitoring for 5 minutes
print("Monitoring system for 5 minutes...")
cpu_stats = monitor_cpu(duration=300)
memory_stats = monitor_memory(duration=300)
gpu_stats = monitor_gpu(duration=300)

print("\nSystem Utilization Report:")
print(f"CPU: Avg {cpu_stats['average']:.1f}%, Max {cpu_stats['max']:.1f}%")
print(f"Memory: Avg {memory_stats['average']:.1f}%, Max {memory_stats['max']:.1f}%")
if isinstance(gpu_stats, dict):
    print(f"GPU Compute: Avg {gpu_stats['utilization']['average']*100:.1f}%, Max {gpu_stats['utilization']['max']*100:.1f}%")
    print(f"GPU Memory: Avg {gpu_stats['memory']['average']*100:.1f}%, Max {gpu_stats['memory']['max']*100:.1f}%")

    implementation_cost,
    
    # Operational costs (annual)
    power_cost_per_year,
    cooling_cost_per_year,
    maintenance_cost_per_year,
    personnel_cost_per_year,
    
    # Benefits (annual)
    performance_gain,  # Speedup factor
    previous_computation_cost_per_year,
    new_revenue_per_year=0,
    
    # Time period
    years=3
):
    # Total initial investment
    initial_investment = hardware_cost + software_cost + implementation_cost
    
    # Annual operational costs
    annual_opex = power_cost_per_year + cooling_cost_per_year + maintenance_cost_per_year + personnel_cost_per_year
    
    # Annual benefits
    # Assume computation cost scales inversely with performance gain
    annual_computation_savings = previous_computation_cost_per_year * (1 - 1/performance_gain)
    annual_benefit = annual_computation_savings + new_revenue_per_year
    
    # Calculate ROI over the specified period
    total_opex = annual_opex * years
    total_benefit = annual_benefit * years
    total_cost = initial_investment + total_opex
    net_benefit = total_benefit - total_cost
    roi_percentage = (net_benefit / total_cost) * 100
    
    payback_period = initial_investment / (annual_benefit - annual_opex)
    
    return {
        "Total Investment": initial_investment,
        "Total Operational Cost": total_opex,
        "Total Benefit": total_benefit,
        "Net Benefit": net_benefit,
        "ROI Percentage": roi_percentage,
        "Payback Period (years)": payback_period if annual_benefit > annual_opex else "Never"
    }

# Example usage
roi = calculate_accelerated_computing_roi(
    hardware_cost=100000,  # $100K for GPU servers
    software_cost=20000,   # $20K for software licenses
    implementation_cost=50000,  # $50K for engineering time
    
    power_cost_per_year=15000,  # $15K for electricity
    cooling_cost_per_year=10000,  # $10K for cooling
    maintenance_cost_per_year=5000,  # $5K for maintenance
    personnel_cost_per_year=120000,  # $120K for specialized staff
    
    performance_gain=10,  # 10x speedup
    previous_computation_cost_per_year=500000,  # $500K in compute costs
    new_revenue_per_year=100000,  # $100K in new revenue opportunities
    
    years=3  # 3-year evaluation period
)

for key, value in roi.items():
    if isinstance(value, float):
        print(f"{key}: ${value:.2f}" if "Period" not in key else f"{key}: {value:.2f}")
