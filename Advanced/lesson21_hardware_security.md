# Lesson 21: Hardware Security for Accelerators

## Overview
This lesson explores the critical security challenges and solutions specific to hardware accelerators in modern computing systems. As specialized accelerators like GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs, and custom ASICs become increasingly central to computing infrastructure—handling sensitive workloads from AI model training to financial analytics—they present unique security concerns that differ significantly from traditional CPU security models. The attack surface, threat vectors, and protection mechanisms for accelerators require specialized understanding and approaches. We'll examine the full spectrum of hardware security considerations for accelerated computing, from silicon-level vulnerabilities to system architecture protections, covering both theoretical attack models and practical defense strategies implemented in commercial systems. This knowledge is essential for designing, deploying, and managing secure accelerated computing infrastructure in an increasingly adversarial environment.

The security landscape for hardware accelerators has evolved dramatically in recent years. While CPUs have benefited from decades of security research and hardening, accelerators were historically designed with performance as the primary goal, often at the expense of security. This security gap has become increasingly problematic as accelerators now process highly sensitive data, from proprietary AI models to financial transactions and personal health information.

Several factors make accelerator security particularly challenging:

1. **Architectural Diversity**: Unlike the relatively standardized CPU security models, each accelerator type (GPU, FPGA, TPU, etc.) has unique architectural features requiring specialized security approaches.

2. **Shared Resource Models**: Many accelerators are designed for high utilization through resource sharing, creating potential security boundaries that must be carefully managed.

3. **Complex Memory Hierarchies**: Specialized memory systems in accelerators often lack the protection mechanisms common in CPU memory architectures.

4. **Firmware Complexity**: Accelerators frequently rely on proprietary firmware that may contain vulnerabilities and is difficult to audit.

5. **Supply Chain Concerns**: The specialized nature of accelerators often involves complex global supply chains with multiple potential points for compromise.

Recent security incidents highlight these challenges. In 2018, researchers demonstrated the "Meltdown-MG" attack that allowed unauthorized memory access across GPU process boundaries. In 2021, the discovery of vulnerabilities in certain FPGA bitstream encryption mechanisms allowed intellectual property theft. Cloud providers have documented numerous attempts to exploit multi-tenant GPU environments to extract sensitive information from other users.

This lesson will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing these challenges, equipping you with the knowledge to design, evaluate, and deploy secure accelerated computing systems across various domains and threat models.

### Side-Channel Attack Vulnerabilities in Accelerators

#### Principles of side-channel attacks in heterogeneous systems

Side-channel attacks exploit information leaked through physical observables during computation rather than through logical vulnerabilities. In heterogeneous computing systems with accelerators, these attacks take on new dimensions due to the unique architectural characteristics of specialized hardware.

**Fundamental concepts of side-channel leakage**

Side-channel leakage occurs when physical properties of a computing system—such as power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, timing behavior, or acoustic signatures—correlate with sensitive operations or data. This correlation allows attackers to infer protected information without directly accessing it through software interfaces. 

For example, when a GPU performs encryption operations, the power consumption pattern may differ depending on the key bits being processed. By precisely measuring this power consumption over multiple operations, an attacker can potentially reconstruct the secret key.

**Information leakage through physical observables**

Accelerators leak information through various physical channels:

- **Power consumption**: Different operations consume varying amounts of power, creating distinctive signatures.
- **Electromagnetic emissions**: Current flows generate electromagnetic fields that can be measured remotely.
- **Timing variations**: Operations take different amounts of time depending on the data being processed.
- **Temperature fluctuations**: Computation intensity affects thermal patterns that can be observed.
- **Acoustic emissions**: Some operations produce characteristic sounds, particularly in high-performance systems.
- **Optical emissions**: In some cases, photonic emissions from transistors can leak information.

**Differences between CPU and accelerator side channels**

Accelerators present unique side-channel characteristics compared to CPUs:

1. **Parallelism amplifies signals**: The highly parallel nature of accelerators like GPUs means that thousands of cores may simultaneously perform the same operation, amplifying side-channel signals and making them easier to detect.

2. **Specialized memory hierarchies**: Unique memory systems in accelerators create distinctive side-channel leakage patterns. For example, GPU shared memory access patterns differ significantly from CPU cache access patterns.

3. **Workload concentration**: Accelerators often execute homogeneous workloads (like matrix multiplication) for extended periods, making statistical analysis of side-channel data more effective.

4. **Limited protection mechanisms**: Many accelerators lack the side-channel mitigation techniques that have been implemented in modern CPUs, such as constant-time operations or protected cache designs.

5. **Shared resource models**: Multi-tenant accelerator usage models often involve deeper resource sharing than CPU virtualization, creating more opportunities for cross-boundary leakage.

**Case Study: NVIDIA GPU AES Implementation**

In 2016, researchers demonstrated a practical side-channel attack against an AES implementation running on an NVIDIA GPU. By measuring electromagnetic emissions during encryption operations, they were able to extract the full AES key. The attack was particularly effective because:

- The GPU's parallel architecture meant that thousands of AES operations occurred simultaneously, strengthening the signal.
- The GPU lacked the side-channel countermeasures present in specialized cryptographic hardware.
- The predictable execution pattern of the GPU's SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Thread) architecture made it easier to correlate emissions with specific operations.

This case highlighted how accelerator architectures can transform the side-channel attack landscape, requiring specialized protection approaches.

**Covert channels vs. side channels in accelerated systems**

While side channels involve unintentional information leakage, covert channels are deliberately constructed communication mechanisms that bypass security controls. In accelerated systems, the distinction is important:

- **Side channels** typically exploit unintended leakage to extract information from a victim process or system. For example, measuring power consumption to determine encryption keys.

- **Covert channels** are intentionally created by colluding entities to communicate across security boundaries. For example, two processes might deliberately manipulate GPU memory access patterns to transmit information between isolated security domains.

Accelerators are particularly vulnerable to covert channel construction due to their numerous shared resources and complex performance optimization features. For instance, researchers have demonstrated covert channels in GPUs using:

- Shared memory bank conflicts
- Cache contention patterns
- Thermal throttling mechanisms
- Memory bus utilization

These covert channels have achieved bandwidth exceeding 100 kbps in some cases, making them practical for exfiltrating sensitive data across security boundaries.

**Threat modeling methodologies for side-channel vulnerabilities**

Effective threat modeling for accelerator side-channel vulnerabilities requires specialized approaches:

1. **Asset identification**: Identify sensitive data and operations processed by accelerators, such as cryptographic keys, proprietary AI models, or personal information.

2. **Attack surface mapping**: Document all physical observables that might leak information, including power, timing, EM emissions, and thermal characteristics.

3. **Attacker capability assessment**: Evaluate realistic attacker access scenarios, from remote timing measurements to physical probing of devices.

4. **Vulnerability analysis**: Analyze how specific accelerator features might amplify side-channel leakage, such as:
   - Shared memory structures
   - Predictable execution patterns
   - Performance counters and telemetry
   - Power management features
   - Thermal monitoring capabilities

5. **Risk quantification**: Estimate the likelihood and impact of different side-channel attacks based on required expertise, equipment, and access.

6. **Mitigation planning**: Develop appropriate countermeasures based on the specific threat model and risk assessment.

**Historical evolution of side-channel attacks on accelerators**

Side-channel attacks on accelerators have evolved significantly over time:

- **Early 2010s**: Initial theoretical work on GPU side-channel vulnerabilities, primarily focused on timing channels in graphics operations.

- **2014-2016**: First practical demonstrations of side-channel attacks against cryptographic implementations on GPUs, primarily using timing and electromagnetic analysis.

- **2017-2019**: Expansion to cloud environments, with demonstrations of cross-VM side-channel attacks using shared GPUs. Development of more sophisticated power and EM analysis techniques specific to accelerator architectures.

- **2020-present**: Emergence of side-channel attacks against AI accelerators, targeting the extraction of model parameters and training data. Increased focus on remote attack scenarios and attacks against edge devices with accelerators.

This evolution reflects both the increasing use of accelerators for sensitive computations and the growing sophistication of attack methodologies tailored to specialized hardware.
  
#### Power analysis attacks against accelerators

Power analysis attacks exploit the relationship between power consumption and the operations being performed by a device. For accelerators, these attacks are particularly effective due to their high power consumption, distinctive operational patterns, and often limited power side-channel protections.

**Simple and differential power analysis techniques**

Power analysis attacks against accelerators typically fall into two categories:

1. **Simple Power Analysis (SPA)**: Directly observes power consumption patterns to identify specific operations or data values. In accelerators, SPA can often identify:
   - The type of operation being performed (e.g., matrix multiplication vs. convolution)
   - Execution phases of algorithms (e.g., key schedule computation vs. encryption rounds)
   - Control flow decisions based on secret data
   - Idle vs. active execution states

2. **Differential Power Analysis (DPA)**: Uses statistical methods to correlate power consumption with specific data values being processed. DPA typically involves:
   - Collecting power traces during multiple operations with different input data
   - Creating hypotheses about intermediate values based on key guesses
   - Statistically correlating these hypotheses with observed power consumption
   - Identifying the correct key based on the strongest correlations

For accelerators, DPA is often enhanced through techniques that leverage architectural features:

- **Multi-channel DPA**: Exploits the parallel nature of accelerators by analyzing power consumption across multiple processing elements simultaneously
- **Template attacks**: Uses machine learning to create power consumption profiles for specific operations on the target accelerator
- **Higher-order DPA**: Combines information from multiple power consumption samples to defeat simple countermeasures

**Power consumption characteristics of different accelerators**

Different accelerator types exhibit distinctive power consumption characteristics that affect their vulnerability to power analysis:

1. **GPUs**:
   - High overall power consumption (200-400W for high-end models)
   - Distinct power signatures for different compute kernels
   - Observable differences between compute-bound and memory-bound operations
   - Power management features (e.g., dynamic frequency scaling) that can create additional leakage
   - Shared power delivery infrastructure that can leak information across different processes

2. **FPGAs**:
   - Highly variable power consumption based on configured logic
   - Localized power signatures tied to specific regions of the device
   - Distinctive patterns during reconfiguration
   - Observable differences between combinational and sequential logic operations
   - Power consumption heavily influenced by routing and placement decisions

3. **TPUs and AI ASICs**:
   - Specialized power profiles for matrix operations
   - Distinctive patterns for different precision computations (FP32 vs. INT8)
   - Activation function execution creates recognizable power signatures
   - Memory access patterns visible in power consumption
   - Batch processing creates repeating power patterns

4. **Cryptocurrency ASICs**:
   - Extremely repetitive power patterns due to homogeneous workloads
   - High correlation between power consumption and specific algorithm steps
   - Distinctive signatures during nonce changes
   - Observable differences based on input data characteristics

**Correlation power analysis on GPU cryptographic implementations**

Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) is particularly effective against GPU cryptographic implementations. This technique uses statistical correlation between predicted intermediate values and measured power consumption to recover secret keys.

A typical CPA attack against a GPU implementation of AES might proceed as follows:

1. The attacker collects power traces while the GPU encrypts multiple known plaintexts.

2. For each possible value of a key byte (0-255), the attacker:
   - Calculates the expected value of an intermediate computation (typically the output of the S-box operation)
   - Creates a power consumption model based on the Hamming weight or Hamming distance of this value
   - Correlates this model with the measured power traces

3. The key byte value that produces the highest correlation is likely the correct one.

GPUs are particularly vulnerable to CPA due to their SIMT execution model, where the same operation is performed on multiple data elements simultaneously. This amplifies the signal related to the target operation, making it easier to extract from background noise.

**Case Study: CPA Attack on GPU-Accelerated AES**

Researchers from Worcester Polytechnic Institute demonstrated a successful CPA attack against an OpenCL implementation of AES running on an AMD GPU. By measuring power consumption during encryption operations, they were able to extract the full AES key with just 30,000 power traces—significantly fewer than would be required for a similar attack on a CPU implementation.

The attack was facilitated by several GPU-specific factors:
- Thousands of AES operations executed in parallel, strengthening the signal
- Limited countermeasures against power analysis in the GPU implementation
- Distinctive power patterns during different AES rounds
- Consistent execution timing due to the GPU's lockstep execution model

**Power monitoring attack vectors in data centers**

In data center environments, power analysis attacks against accelerators can be executed through various monitoring points:

1. **Power Distribution Unit (PDU) monitoring**: Many data centers provide power consumption metrics through PDUs, which can be granular enough to enable attacks if an adversary has access to this telemetry.

2. **Server-level power monitoring**: BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) interfaces often expose power consumption data that can be used for attacks if these management interfaces are compromised.

3. **Power supply side-channels**: Shared power supplies within servers can leak information between different components, allowing a malicious process to monitor accelerator operations.

4. **Thermal sensors**: Power consumption correlates with heat generation, so thermal sensors can serve as proxies for power monitoring in some attack scenarios.

5. **Voltage fluctuations on shared power rails**: Accelerator operations can cause voltage fluctuations that affect other components, creating another potential monitoring vector.

**Remote power analysis through shared infrastructure**

While traditional power analysis requires physical access to the target device, several techniques enable remote power analysis in shared accelerator environments:

1. **Software-based power monitoring**: Many accelerators expose power consumption data through APIs or system interfaces. For example:
   - NVIDIA's NVML library provides power consumption data for GPUs
   - Intel's RAPL interface exposes energy consumption metrics
   - Cloud providers often make power metrics available for billing and optimization

2. **Microarchitectural power side-channels**: Shared resources within accelerators can leak power consumption information:
   - Execution unit contention patterns
   - Memory bus utilization
   - Thermal throttling behaviors
   - Clock frequency adjustments

3. **Cross-VM power monitoring**: In virtualized environments, a malicious VM can potentially monitor the power consumption of other VMs sharing the same physical accelerator through:
   - Timing variations in shared resources
   - Performance counter information
   - Thermal side-channels
   - Power supply voltage fluctuations

**Workload fingerprinting through power signatures**

Power consumption patterns can reveal information about the workloads running on accelerators, even without extracting specific data values. This "workload fingerprinting" has significant privacy and security implications:

1. **AI model identification**: Different neural network architectures produce distinctive power consumption patterns, potentially allowing attackers to identify proprietary model architectures.

2. **Algorithm recognition**: Cryptographic algorithms, compression methods, and other security-sensitive operations have recognizable power signatures.

3. **Input data characterization**: Power consumption can reveal properties of the input data, such as image complexity in GPU-accelerated image processing or transaction characteristics in financial workloads.

4. **Processing phase identification**: Many applications have distinct processing phases with different power profiles, revealing information about the operation being performed.

**Case studies: power analysis of GPU cryptographic algorithms**

Several notable research efforts have demonstrated practical power analysis attacks against GPU cryptographic implementations:

1. **"ECDSA Key Extraction from Mobile Devices via Nonintrusive Physical Side Channels"** (USENIX Security 2016):
   - Demonstrated key extraction from ECDSA implementations on mobile GPUs
   - Used electromagnetic emissions as a proxy for power consumption
   - Required only near-field access to the device
   - Recovered keys with just a few hundred observations

2. **"GPU Side-Channel Attacks: The Need for Isochronous Computations"** (CHES 2020):
   - Showed successful power analysis attacks against multiple GPU cryptographic implementations
   - Highlighted how GPU optimization features create additional side-channel leakage
   - Demonstrated attacks in both local and cloud environments
   - Proposed countermeasures specific to GPU architectures

   - Revealed how power analysis can compromise privacy in GPU-accelerated monitoring systems
   - Demonstrated extraction of monitored content from power signatures
   - Showed that even encrypted processing leaks information through power channels
   - Proposed hardware modifications to mitigate these risks

These case studies highlight the practical feasibility of power analysis attacks against accelerator implementations and the need for specialized countermeasures in security-sensitive applications.
  
#### Timing attacks in parallel processing environments

Timing attacks exploit variations in execution time to infer sensitive information. In parallel processing environments like GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators, timing attacks take on unique characteristics due to complex scheduling, shared resources, and specialized execution models.

**Execution time variability in accelerator architectures**

Accelerators exhibit various sources of timing variability that can leak information:

1. **Control flow divergence**: In SIMT architectures like GPUs, conditional execution based on sensitive data creates observable timing differences. When threads in a warp take different execution paths, the entire warp's execution time is determined by the longest path, creating a timing channel.

2. **Memory access patterns**: Data-dependent memory access patterns lead to varying cache hit/miss patterns, memory bank conflicts, and DRAM row buffer hits/misses. These variations create measurable timing differences that can reveal sensitive information.

3. **Resource contention**: When multiple processes share accelerator resources, the timing of one process can be affected by another's resource usage, creating both side-channel leakage and covert channel opportunities.

4. **Dynamic optimization features**: Many accelerators implement dynamic optimizations like frequency scaling, power gating, or adaptive scheduling that can amplify timing variations based on workload characteristics.

5. **Synchronization mechanisms**: Barrier synchronization, atomic operations, and other coordination primitives in parallel environments create timing channels when their performance depends on sensitive data.

**Example: Control Flow Timing Channel in GPU Cryptography**

Consider a GPU implementation of a cryptographic algorithm with a conditional branch based on a key bit:

```
if (key_bit[i] == 1) {
    // Operation A (takes 10 cycles)
} else {
    // Operation B (takes 5 cycles)
}
```

In a GPU's SIMT execution model, if some threads process key bits with value 1 and others process key bits with value 0, all threads will wait for the longest operation (10 cycles). By measuring the total execution time across multiple runs with different inputs, an attacker can determine which key bits are 1s and which are 0s based on timing variations.

**Contention-based timing channels in shared resources**

Shared accelerator resources create powerful timing channels through contention:

1. **Compute unit contention**: When multiple processes share compute units, the execution time of one process is affected by the computational intensity of others.

2. **Memory bandwidth contention**: Processes competing for memory bandwidth experience timing variations based on others' memory access patterns.

3. **Cache contention**: Shared caches in accelerators allow one process to evict another's data, creating timing variations that leak information.

4. **Interconnect contention**: On-chip and off-chip interconnects can become bottlenecks, with timing dependent on communication patterns of other processes.

5. **Special function unit contention**: Specialized units (e.g., tensor cores, ray tracing units) are often shared resources with limited availability, creating contention-based timing channels.

**Practical Attack: GPU Cache Timing Channel**

Researchers demonstrated a practical timing side-channel attack using GPU cache contention:

1. A victim process performs cryptographic operations with execution time varying based on secret key bits.

2. An attacker process repeatedly accesses specific memory locations, creating cache contention.

3. By measuring its own memory access times, the attacker can determine when the victim accesses particular cache lines.

4. These observations allow the attacker to infer the victim's memory access pattern and, consequently, the secret key.

This attack was demonstrated in both native and virtualized GPU environments, achieving key extraction with high reliability.

**Timing attack vectors in GPU computing**

GPUs present several specific timing attack vectors:

1. **Warp scheduling timing channels**: The GPU scheduler's decisions can leak information about thread execution patterns, which may correlate with sensitive data.

2. **Shared memory bank conflicts**: When multiple threads access the same shared memory bank, serialization occurs, creating timing variations that depend on access patterns.

3. **L1/L2 cache timing**: GPU cache hierarchies can leak information through access timing, similar to CPU cache timing attacks but with architectural differences.

4. **Global memory coalescing**: The efficiency of global memory access depends on access patterns, creating timing variations that can reveal information about data being processed.

5. **Atomic operation contention**: Atomic operations on shared locations create serialization points with timing dependent on access patterns.

6. **Texture cache access patterns**: Specialized texture caches have unique timing characteristics that can leak information about access patterns.

**Case Study: AES Key Recovery via GPU Timing Channels**

In a notable demonstration, researchers from North Carolina State University extracted AES keys from a GPU implementation using timing side channels:

1. They implemented AES encryption on a GPU where table lookups were influenced by key bytes.

2. By measuring execution time variations across thousands of encryptions with known plaintexts, they identified correlations between timing and key values.

3. Using statistical analysis, they successfully recovered the full AES key.

4. The attack was effective even with the noise introduced by the GPU's complex scheduling and memory system.

This case study highlighted how classical timing attacks can be adapted to GPU architectures, despite the parallel execution model and additional sources of timing noise.

**Scheduler-induced timing variations**

Accelerator schedulers create unique timing channels:

1. **Workload-dependent scheduling decisions**: Many accelerator schedulers make decisions based on workload characteristics, which may correlate with sensitive data.

2. **Priority-based scheduling**: When scheduler priorities are influenced by application behavior, timing variations can leak information.

3. **Preemption policies**: The conditions under which tasks are preempted can create observable timing differences.

4. **Gang scheduling effects**: When groups of threads are scheduled together, the timing behavior of one thread can affect others, creating information leakage.

5. **Power-aware scheduling**: Schedulers that consider power consumption may make decisions that correlate with the data being processed.

**Memory access timing side channels**

Memory systems in accelerators create particularly rich timing side channels:

1. **DRAM row buffer timing**: Accessing data in an already-open DRAM row is faster than accessing data requiring a new row to be opened, creating timing variations based on access patterns.

2. **Memory controller queuing**: When memory requests queue at the controller, timing depends on the overall access pattern across all processes.

3. **HBM stack conflicts**: High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) used in many modern accelerators has unique timing characteristics when different stacks or channels are accessed.

4. **TLB timing channels**: Address translation timing varies based on TLB hit/miss patterns, which depend on memory access patterns.

5. **Memory compression timing**: Some accelerators use memory compression techniques with data-dependent performance, creating timing channels.

**Synchronization primitives as timing channels**

Parallel programming synchronization mechanisms create powerful timing channels:

1. **Barrier synchronization**: When threads wait at a barrier, the last thread to arrive determines the overall timing, leaking information about its execution time.

2. **Atomic operation contention**: Contention on atomic operations creates timing variations based on how many threads attempt to access the same location.

3. **Lock acquisition timing**: The time to acquire a lock depends on contention, which may correlate with sensitive data.

4. **Event signaling delays**: When one thread signals an event to another, the timing can reveal information about the signaler's execution.

5. **Work distribution imbalance**: In dynamic work distribution schemes, timing variations can reveal information about the data being processed.

**Practical demonstrations of timing attacks on accelerators**

## Key Terminology
- **Side-channel attack**: A form of attack that exploits information gained from the physical implementation of a system (such as timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or sound) rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself. Accelerators often have unique side-channel characteristics different from CPUs.

- **Root of trust**: The foundation of security in a system that must be implicitly trusted; typically a hardware component that serves as the first link in a chain of trust and cannot be updated or modified through software. In accelerators, this may be implemented as immutable boot ROM, security processors, or hardware security modules.

- **Hardware trojan**: A malicious modification to hardware that creates a backdoor or vulnerability, inserted during design or manufacturing. Accelerators with complex supply chains and third-party IP are particularly vulnerable to such modifications.

- **Attestation**: The process of providing cryptographically verifiable evidence about the state or identity of hardware or software, allowing a relying party to make trust decisions. Remote attestation for accelerators enables verification that the correct and unmodified hardware and firmware are in use.

- **Secure enclave**: An isolated execution environment protected from the rest of the system, even from privileged system software like the operating system or hypervisor. Secure enclaves in accelerators provide protected regions for sensitive computation like cryptographic operations or AI model execution.

- **IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit)**: A memory management unit that connects a direct-memory-access-capable I/O bus to the main memory, providing memory address translation and access protection. IOMMUs are critical for isolating accelerators and preventing DMA attacks.

- **Confidential computing**: A security paradigm focused on protecting data in use (during processing) through hardware-based trusted execution environments, extending beyond traditional protection of data at rest and data in transit. Applying confidential computing principles to accelerators is an emerging area of development.

- **Hardware security module (HSM)**: A physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions, and provides strong authentication. HSMs may be integrated with accelerators or used to protect keys used by accelerator subsystems.

- **Trusted execution environment (TEE)**: A secure area within a main processor that ensures sensitive data is stored, processed, and protected in an isolated, trusted environment. TEE concepts are being extended to accelerators to provide similar protections.

- **Side-channel resistance**: Design techniques that prevent information leakage through side channels, such as constant-time implementations, power balancing, and noise injection. Accelerators require specialized side-channel resistance techniques due to their unique architectures.

- **Formal verification**: Mathematical approaches to proving that a system satisfies specific properties, particularly important for security-critical features. Formal verification of accelerators is challenging due to their complexity but essential for high-assurance applications.

- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Security mechanisms that prevent different users or workloads sharing the same physical hardware from interfering with or observing each other. This is particularly important for accelerators in cloud environments where resources are shared among multiple customers.
