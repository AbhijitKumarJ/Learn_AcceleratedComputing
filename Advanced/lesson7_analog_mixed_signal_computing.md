# Lesson 7: Analog and Mixed-Signal Computing

## Introduction
Analog computing, once overshadowed by the digital revolution, is experiencing a renaissance driven by the need for energy-efficient processing of real-world data. This lesson explores how modern analog and mixed-signal computing approaches combine the efficiency of analog processing with the precision and programmability of digital systems, creating powerful new paradigms for specialized workloads like neural networks, sensor processing, and edge AI.

The physical world we interact with is inherently analog—continuous rather than discrete. Sensors capture analog signals (temperature, pressure, light, sound), and actuators operate in the analog domain. The traditional computing approach digitizes these signals, processes them digitally, and then converts back to analog when necessary. This conversion process introduces latency, consumes energy, and can lose information. Analog computing offers an alternative by processing information directly in the analog domain, potentially achieving significant improvements in energy efficiency, latency, and natural signal processing.

As we approach the physical limits of digital computing, with Moore's Law slowing and Dennard scaling ending, analog and mixed-signal computing presents a compelling alternative path for continued advancement in specialized domains. This lesson will explore the principles, implementations, challenges, and applications of this re-emerging computing paradigm.
