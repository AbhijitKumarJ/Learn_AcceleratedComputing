# Lesson 2: In-Memory Computing

## Introduction
In-Memory Computing represents a paradigm shift in computer architecture that addresses one of the most fundamental bottlenecks in modern computing systems: the separation between processing and memory. As computational capabilities have grown exponentially following Moore's Law, memory access speeds have improved at a much slower rate, creating what is known as the "memory wall." In-memory computing aims to overcome this limitation by performing computations directly within or near memory units, dramatically reducing data movement and enabling new levels of performance and energy efficiency for data-intensive applications.

## Subtopics:
- The fundamental concept of processing-in-memory (PIM)
- Near-memory vs. in-memory computing approaches
- Resistive RAM (ReRAM) and memristor-based computing
- Phase-change memory (PCM) for computational storage
- Analog in-memory computing for neural networks
- Digital in-memory computing architectures
- Addressing the memory wall through in-situ processing
- Commercial implementations and research prototypes

## Key Terminology and Concept Definitions
- **Processing-in-Memory (PIM)**: Computing paradigm that performs calculations directly within memory units, eliminating the need to transfer data between separate processing and memory components. This approach fundamentally changes the von Neumann architecture that has dominated computing for decades.

- **Memory Wall**: The growing disparity between processor and memory speeds that limits computational performance. While processor speeds have increased exponentially following Moore's Law, memory access speeds have improved much more slowly, creating a bottleneck in data-intensive applications.

- **Near-Memory Computing**: An architectural approach that places processing elements physically close to memory to reduce data movement distance and latency. This represents a compromise between traditional architectures and true in-memory computing.

- **In-Memory Computing**: A more radical approach that performs computations directly within memory cells, using the physical properties of memory devices to perform computational operations.

- **Memristor**: A two-terminal electrical component that maintains a relationship between charge and flux linkage. Memristors can "remember" the amount of charge that has flowed through them, making them suitable for both memory and computation.

- **ReRAM (Resistive RAM)**: Non-volatile memory that works by changing the resistance across a dielectric material. ReRAM cells can be arranged in crossbar arrays to perform matrix operations directly in memory.

- **PCM (Phase-Change Memory)**: Memory technology that uses the unique behavior of chalcogenide glass to switch between amorphous and crystalline states with different electrical resistance properties. PCM can be used for both storage and computation.

- **Crossbar Array**: A grid-like structure of perpendicular conductive lines with memory elements at each intersection. Crossbar arrays are fundamental to many in-memory computing implementations, especially for matrix operations.

- **Stateful Logic**: Computational approach where the state (e.g., resistance) of a memory element is used to perform logical operations, blurring the line between memory and computation.

        self.rows = rows
        self.cols = cols
        self.precision_bits = precision_bits
        # Initialize weights with random values
        self.weights = np.random.uniform(0, 1, (rows, cols))
        # Quantize weights to simulate limited precision
        self.quantize_weights()
        
    def quantize_weights(self):
        # Simulate limited precision of ReRAM cells
        levels = 2**self.precision_bits
        self.weights = np.round(self.weights * (levels-1)) / (levels-1)
        
    def program_weights(self, weight_matrix):
        # Program the crossbar with provided weights
        assert weight_matrix.shape == (self.rows, self.cols), "Weight matrix dimensions mismatch"
        self.weights = weight_matrix
        self.quantize_weights()
        
    def simulate_noise(self):
        # Add noise to simulate device variation and read noise
        noise_level = 0.01  # 1% noise
        noise = np.random.normal(0, noise_level, self.weights.shape)

    def matrix_vector_multiply(self, input_vector):
        # Ensure input vector has correct dimensions
        assert len(input_vector) == self.cols, "Input vector dimension mismatch"
        
        # Quantize input to simulate DAC precision
        input_levels = 2**8  # Assuming 8-bit DAC
        input_quantized = np.round(input_vector * (input_levels-1)) / (input_levels-1)
        
        # Simulate matrix-vector multiplication with noise
        noisy_weights = self.simulate_noise()
        result = np.dot(noisy_weights, input_quantized)

# Compare with standard numpy implementation
expected_output = np.dot(crossbar.weights, input_vector)
error = np.abs(output - expected_output).mean()
print(f"Average absolute error: {error:.6f}")

# Measure performance (conceptual)
import time

# Conventional approach (CPU)
start_time = time.time()
for _ in range(1000):
    _ = np.dot(crossbar.weights, input_vector)
cpu_time = time.time() - start_time

# In-memory approach (simulated)
start_time = time.time()
for _ in range(1000):
    _ = crossbar.matrix_vector_multiply(input_vector)
pim_time = time.time() - start_time

# Note: This is just simulation overhead, not actual performance
# In real hardware, PIM would be much faster
print(f"Simulated operations per second (CPU): {1000/cpu_time:.2f}")
print(f"Simulated operations per second (PIM): {1000/pim_time:.2f}")

            activation = self.relu(z)
        
        # Output layer (no activation for simplicity)
        output = self.crossbars[-1].matrix_vector_multiply(activation)
        return output

# Example usage
# Create a simple neural network with 784->128->64->10 architecture (MNIST-like)
nn = PIMNeuralNetwork([784, 128, 64, 10])

# Generate a random input (simulating an MNIST image)
input_data = np.random.uniform(0, 1, 784)

# Perform inference
output = nn.forward(input_data)
predicted_class = np.argmax(output)
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
print(f"Output probabilities: {output}")

# In a real implementation, we would:
# 1. Load actual trained weights into the crossbars
# 2. Implement proper quantization for the weights
# 3. Account for hardware-specific constraints
# 4. Optimize data movement between layers
```

This example demonstrates how a neural network could be implemented using in-memory computing crossbars for the matrix multiplications in each layer.

    compute_energy = M*N*K * (ENERGY_COST['FLOAT_MULT'] + ENERGY_COST['FLOAT_ADD'])
    
    # Energy for storing result back to DRAM
    store_energy = M*N * ENERGY_COST['DRAM_ACCESS']
    
    return load_energy + compute_energy + store_energy

    load_weights_energy = K*N * ENERGY_COST['DRAM_ACCESS'] / 100  # Amortized over many operations
    
    # Energy for streaming input matrix
    stream_input_energy = M*K * ENERGY_COST['DRAM_ACCESS'] / 10  # Reduced due to streaming
    
    # Energy for computation in PIM
    compute_energy = M*N*K * ENERGY_COST['PIM_MULT_ACCUMULATE']

    return load_weights_energy + stream_input_energy + compute_energy + read_results_energy

# Compare energy consumption for different matrix sizes
matrix_sizes = [(64, 64, 64), (256, 256, 256), (1024, 1024, 1024)]

for M, N, K in matrix_sizes:
    conventional_energy = estimate_conventional_matmul_energy(M, N, K)
    pim_energy = estimate_pim_matmul_energy(M, N, K)
    
    print(f"Matrix multiplication {M}x{K} * {K}x{N}:")
    print(f"  Conventional: {conventional_energy/1e6:.2f} microjoules")
    print(f"  PIM:          {pim_energy/1e6:.2f} microjoules")
    print(f"  Improvement:  {conventional_energy/pim_energy:.1f}x")
    print()
