# Lesson 27: Quantum-Classical Hybrid Systems

## Introduction
Quantum-classical hybrid systems represent a pragmatic approach to leveraging quantum computing capabilities while acknowledging the current limitations of quantum hardware. These systems combine the strengths of classical computing architectures with the unique computational advantages of quantum processors, creating a bridge between current technology and the quantum future.

In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, pure quantum computing faces significant challenges including limited qubit counts, short coherence times, and high error rates. Hybrid approaches allow us to harness quantum advantages for specific computational tasks while relying on classical systems for tasks they excel at, such as control, optimization, and error mitigation.

This hybrid paradigm isn't merely a stopgap solution but represents a fundamental architectural approach that will likely persist even as quantum hardware matures. The synergy between classical and quantum computing creates opportunities for novel algorithms and applications that wouldn't be possible with either approach alone.

# Convert to Pauli Sum Operator
hamiltonian_op = PauliSumOp(h2_hamiltonian)
```

### Quantum Circuit Construction (Quantum Component)

```python
def create_ansatz(parameters):
    """Create a parameterized quantum circuit for the VQE ansatz."""
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    
    # Initial state preparation (Hartree-Fock state for H₂)
    qc.x(0)
    
    # Variational form (hardware-efficient ansatz)
    # First variational layer
    qc.ry(parameters[0], 0)
    qc.ry(parameters[1], 1)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    
    # Second variational layer
    qc.ry(parameters[2], 0)
    qc.ry(parameters[3], 1)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    
    return qc
```

### Hybrid Execution Loop

```python
def compute_expectation(parameters):
    """
    Compute the expectation value of the Hamiltonian with respect to 
    the quantum state prepared by the ansatz.
    """
    # Create the trial circuit
    qc = create_ansatz(parameters)
    
    # Compute expectation values for each Pauli term in the Hamiltonian
    # In practice, this would be done by measuring the quantum circuit
    # in different bases corresponding to each Pauli term
    
    # For this example, we'll use a statevector simulator
    backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
    job = execute(qc, backend)
    statevector = job.result().get_statevector()
    
    # Compute expectation value
    expectation = hamiltonian_op.eval_matrix_element(statevector)
    
    return np.real(expectation)

# Classical optimization loop
def vqe_optimization():
    # Initial parameters (random starting point)
    initial_params = np.random.rand(4) * 2 * np.pi
    
    # Classical optimizer (COBYLA)
    optimizer = COBYLA(maxiter=100)
    
    # Run the optimization
    result = optimizer.minimize(compute_expectation, initial_params)
    
    # Extract results
    optimal_params = result.x
    minimal_energy = result.fun
    
    return optimal_params, minimal_energy

# Execute the VQE algorithm
optimal_params, ground_state_energy = vqe_optimization()

print(f"Optimized Parameters: {optimal_params}")

### Result Interpretation and Validation

```python
# Prepare the ground state with optimal parameters
final_circuit = create_ansatz(optimal_params)

# Analyze the resulting state
backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
job = execute(final_circuit, backend)
statevector = job.result().get_statevector()

# Compute occupation probabilities
probabilities = np.abs(statevector)**2

print("\nGround State Composition:")
for i, prob in enumerate(probabilities):
    if prob > 0.01:  # Only show significant contributions
        print(f"State |{bin(i)[2:].zfill(2)}>: {prob:.4f}")

# Compare with exact diagonalization (classical)
from scipy.linalg import eigh

# Convert Hamiltonian to matrix form for classical solution
h_matrix = hamiltonian_op.to_matrix()
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = eigh(h_matrix)

print("\nClassical Exact Diagonalization:")
print(f"Ground State Energy: {eigenvalues[0]} Hartree")
print(f"First Excited State Energy: {eigenvalues[1]} Hartree")

# Calculate error in VQE result
error = abs(ground_state_energy - eigenvalues[0])
print(f"\nVQE Error: {error} Hartree")
```

This example demonstrates the key components of a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm:
1. Classical problem formulation (defining the Hamiltonian)
2. Quantum circuit design (creating the parameterized ansatz)
3. Hybrid execution (quantum expectation value calculation + classical optimization)
4. Result interpretation and validation
